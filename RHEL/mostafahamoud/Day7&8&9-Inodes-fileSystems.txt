The Master Boot Record (MBR) and inode number serve very different purposes in a computer's storage system. Here's a breakdown of each:

### Master Boot Record (MBR)

**Purpose:**
- The MBR is a special type of boot sector located at the very beginning of partitioned storage devices like hard drives or SSDs.
- It contains the information required to boot the operating system, including the partition table that describes the layout of the partitions on the storage device.

**Key Features:**
- **Location:** The first sector of a storage device (sector 0).
- **Size:** Typically 512 bytes.
- **Components:** 
  - Bootloader: A small program that loads the operating system's bootloader.
  - Partition Table (64 bytes): Contains entries for the primary partitions (up to 4 in a traditional MBR scheme). each one has 16 bytes
  - Magic Number: Used to validate the integrity of the MBR.

**Usage:**
- Essential for booting legacy BIOS systems.
- Defines the structure of the storage device and the location of the partitions.

### Inode Number

**Purpose:**
- An inode number is an identifier used by many Unix-like file systems to identify files and directories.
- Each inode contains metadata about a file or directory (e.g., permissions, ownership, size, timestamps, and disk block locations) but not the name or the actual data content.

**Key Features:**
- **Location:** Spread throughout the file system; each file and directory has an associated inode.
- **Components:** 
  - Metadata: Information about the file/directory.
  - Pointers: Addresses pointing to the actual data blocks on the disk.

**Usage:**
- Used internally by the file system to manage and locate files.
- Allows efficient file access and management by separating metadata from file names.

### Comparison

| Feature                | MBR                             | Inode Number                    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Bootstrapping and partitioning  | File system metadata management |
| **Location**           | First sector of storage device  | Throughout the file system      |
| **Size**               | 512 bytes typically             | Varies                          |
| **Content**            | Bootloader, partition table     | File metadata, pointers         |
| **Relevance**          | Boot process, partition layout  | File access and management      |
| **Operating System**   | Legacy BIOS systems             | Unix-like file systems          |

In summary, the MBR is crucial for booting and partition management, while inode numbers are essential for file system organization and file management. 


lsblk : used to list information about all available block devices.

fdisk -l : list connected disks 

fdisk /dev/sda : 



partprobe /dev/sda : reload partition table

mkfs.<filesystem>  :create file system
