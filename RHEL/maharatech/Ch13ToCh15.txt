==========Archiving and Transferring Files===========

Goal:
    Archive and copy files from one system to another.

Objectives: 
    Archive files and directories into a comperessed file using tar,
    and extract the contents of an existing tar archive.

    Transfer files to or form a remote system securely using SSH.


Managing and comperessedd TAR Archives 
    Archiving and Compressings files are useful when creating backups nd transferring data across a network 
    One of the oldest and most common commands for creatgin and working with backup archives is the <tar> command.

Options of the Tar command  
    tar -cvf ect_backup_a
        -c,--create : Create a new archive.
        -x,--extract : Extract from an existing archive.
        -t,--list : List the table of contents of an archive.
        -v,--verbose : Verbose. Shows which files get archived or extracted.
        -f,--file= :This option must be followed by the file name of the archive to user or create.
        -p,--preserve-permissions : preseve the permissions of files and directiories when extracting an archive, without subrtacting the umask.


    du <Dir/file> : estimate file space usage
        -s : Sammary 
        -sh : Sammary and Human Reading 

createing acompressed archive.
    the tar command supports three compression methods.
    gzip
    bzip2
    xz

    use one of the follwing Options to create a compressed tar archive.

        tar -czf ect_backup.tar.gz etc
        tar -cjf ect_backup.tar.bz2 etc
        tar -cJf ect_backup.tar.xz etc
            -z,--gzip : use gzip compression(.tar.gz)
            -j,--bzip2 : use bzip2 compression(.tar.bz2). bzip2 typically achivees abetter compression ratio than gzip.
            -J,--xz : use xz compression(.tar.xz). The xz compression typically achieves. abetter compression ratio than bzip2.

        du -sh *
            #27M ect
            #24M ect_backup_20240923.tar
            #4.8M ect_backup.tar.bz2
            #5.6M ect_backup.tar.gz
            #4.1M ect_backup.tar.xz

    Extract Files

        tar -xzf ect_backup.tar.gz
        tar -xjf ect_backup.tar.bz2
        tar -xJf ect_backup.tar.xz

compress and extract files using gzip,bzip2and xz.

    compress
        gzip etc.tar
        bzip2 abc.tar
        xz myarchive.tar
    extract
        gunzip etc.tar
        bunzip2 abc.tar
        unxz myarchive.tar

Transferring files using secure copy
    The secure copy command, scp, which is part of the OpenSSH suite, copies files from a remote 
    system to the local system or from the local system to a remote system.

    scp <localfile/localdir> <remoteuser@IP>:<file/dir> : from local srever to remote.
        # scp etc.tar root@192.168.1.10:/root : copy etc.tar from here to /root in remote.

    scp <file/dir>:<remotefile/remotedir> <localfile/localdir> : from remote to local.
        # scp root@192.168.1.10:/root/date.txt . : copy date.txt form root to here.

Transferring files using the secure file Transfer program
    To interactively upload or download files from a SSH server, use the Secure File Transfer Program,sftp.
    A session with the sftp command uses the secure authentication mechanism and encrypted data transfer to and from the SSH server.

    sftp <remoteuser@remotehost>
        #sftp root@192.168.1.10

        l<comand>: to run command localy.
            # lpwd : print local working directory

        put <filename> : to upload file .
            # put etc.tar : upload etc.tar to remote
        get <filename> : to download file.
            # get date.txt : download date.txt form remote
