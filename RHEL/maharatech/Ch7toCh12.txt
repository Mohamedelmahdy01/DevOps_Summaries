==============Controlling access files==========

file types
	d : directory
	- : file
	c : char device (file)  
	b : block device (file) 
	l : link file 
	p : pipe file 



-rwxr-x--- 1 root root 0 oct 31 11:06 test 

Change Permissions of Files and Dierectories (Symbolic Method)

	u
	g + r
chmod   o - w <filename> 
	a   x
u,g,o,a(for user,group,other,all)
+,-,=(for add, remove ,set exactly)
r,w,x(for read,wirte,executeable)


chmod a + rwx test
chmod u+rwx, g=rx,o - wx test



Change Permissions of Files and Dierectories (Numeric Method)

7   6   5   4   3   2   1 
111 110 101 100 011 010 001
rwx rw- r-x r-- -wx -w- --x


chmod 777 test

chown mohamed file1 : change the ownership
chown mohamed:mohamed file1 : change the owner and group 
chown :moahmed file1 : change group ownership
chgrp mohamed  file1 : change group ownership
chown -R root:root file1 : change owner and group ownership for dir and its file

standard permissions


special permissions 
	: special permissions provide additional access-related features over and above what the basic permission types allow.
symbolically : setuid = u+s; setgid = g+s; sticly = o+t    
	chmod g+s dir1

numerically (fourth preceding digit): setuid = 4; setgid =2;sticky =1 
	chmod 2770 dir1 

which <file> : search about file
locate <file> : search from db 
updatedb : to update database (important for locate)



default file permissions 

umask : display the current value of the shell's umask. ( root = 0022 , regular user = 0002)

			
0   2   2 (decimal)						0   0   2 (decimal)			
000 010 010 (binary)					000 000 010 (binary)
111 101 101 (Reverse)					111 111 101 (Reverse)
rwx r-x r-x dir (symolically)				rwx rwx r-x dir (symolically)
rw- r-- r-- file (remove x)				rw- rw- r-- file (remove x)

umask 007 
umask take effect at current bash. 

the system's default umask values for Bash shell users are defined in the /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc files.
users can override the system defaults in teh (.bash_profile and .bashrc) files in their home directories.
	.bashrc : It works every time I open a new bash
	.bash_profile : It works once when you log in. 
echo "umask 007" >> ~/.bashrc 




==========Monitoring and Managing Linux processes==============

A process is a running instance of a launched ,executable program

Any process may create a child process 

Every process assigned PID and PPID 


whoami : display effective user 



ps  : list currant processes 

ps aux : display all processes including processes without a controlling terminal 
ps lax : A long listing provides more technical detail. 
top : like Take Manager in Windows
pstree : displays all processes as tree
pstree -p : display all processes as tree with PID
pstree -p mohamed : display processes of a specific user 
pgrep pu mohamed -l : show process name of a specific user


<command> & : run command in Background 
jobs == ps j : list command or process run in background 
fg %<job number> : return process to foreground


kill <PID> :kill process
Kill -l : list each signal 
  
Kill -15 <PID> : default kill signal
kill -9 : aggressive termination 
kill -1 : (SIGHUB) to reload an re0read the configurations (configuration reload without termination)

pidof <Pname>: print id of process
killall sleep : kill each sleep's processes 
pkill  -U mohamed : kill all Mohamed's processes 

top : dynamic view of the system's processes.
   -n 2 : specifies the maxinum number of iterations 
   -d 2 : number of second betwwen each update 


Linux process scheduling and multitasking: 

ps lax | less : list processes with nice number

ps axo user,pid,nice,command : list user,pid,nice,command 


nice vim text : start process with a user difined priority(10).
nice -n 10 vim text & : start process with a 10 priority.


renice <nice value > <process id> : renice process (nice value form -20 to 19)

renice 19 $(pgrep sleep) : set 19 of all sleep process priority 
killall <proc name> : kill processes 









=============controlling services  and daemons ==========

systemd is a first process that starts in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (PID 1) 

systemctl list-units --type = service : list all active services

systemctl list-units --type =  --all : list all active and inactive services

systemctl --failed --type= service : list filed service

systemctl status <service name> : view service status.

	systemctl status sshd.service 

systemctl is-active sshd.service : display service active or inactive 

systemctl is-enabled sshd.service : display service enable or disable

systemctl is-failed sshd.service : display service active or failed 

systemctl start sshd.service : to start a service 

systemctl restart sshd.service : to restart a service 

systemctl reload sshd.serivce : to reload a service (re-read the configuration file)  

systemctl stop sshd.service : to stop currently running service 

systemcl list-dependencies unit : display a hierarchy mapping of dependencies to start the service unit.

systemctl mask sendmaill.service : mask service
  
systemctl unmask sendmaill.service : unmask service  

systemctl enblle sshd.service : to start a service at boot 

systemctl disable sshd.service : to disable the service from start automatically. 

=========================Configuration and securing ssh ===================



ssh <username>@<remotehost> : create accessing remote interactive shell.

ssh <student>@<serverb> <hostname> : the ssh command would run the <hostname> on the <serverb> remote system as a <student> user without accessing the remote interactive shell. 

ssh <username>@<remotehost> 'date;ls -lh' : execute commands without create interactive shell.


we have two type of authentication 
				   1- password authentication 
				   2- keys authentication 

ssh-keygen : to create a private key and matching public key for authentication. 
	     your private and public keys are saved in your  ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub files, respectively. 
	     the permission modes must be 600 on the private key and 644 on the public key

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mohamed@192.168.1.10 : copies the public key of ssh keypair to the destination system(mohamed)
You can do this manually
	1-copy puplic key from ~/.ssh/idrsa,pub(clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
	2-go to server > /root/.ssh > open authorized_keys (vi authorized_keys)
	3-Paste the public key and save it


Costomize ssh service configuration
	OpenSSH service os provided by daemon called sshd. Its main configuration file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

	PermitRootLogin : User can authenticate as root or not.
		PermitRootLogin no : disable root login
	PasswordAuthentication : The user can authenticate with password or not.
		PasswordAuthentication no : disable password authentication
	systemctl related sshd.service : reload services to apply the modification.

	#ssh conect by default at port 22




=========Analyzing and storing logs===============

	goal 
		logcate and accurately interpert logs of systems events for troubleshootin purposes.
	

	Objectives 
		Describe the basic loggin architecture used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux to record events.
		Understand logrotat utility
		View and manage logs using journalctl command
		configure the time zone and adjust the system time
System Logging
	processes and the operating system kernel record a log of events that happen. the logs are used to audit the system and troubleshoot problems.
	systems record logs of events in text file which are kept in teh /var/log directory.
	
	syslog messages are handled by two service.
	systemd-journald : The Journal is a component of systemd that is responsible ofr viewing and management of log files (stor in /run/log/journal/ )
	rsyslog : The rsylog service sorts and writes syslog messages to the log files that do persist acroos roboots in /var/log
		Log files
			/var/log/messages
			~	~	secure :related to secureity and authentication events.
			~	~	maillog : related to the mail server.
			~	~	cron : related to scheduled job execution.
			~	~	boot.log : related to system startup.


	overview of systlog priorities
- 0: Emergency — System is unusable
- 1: Alert — Immediate action needed
- 2: Critical — Critical conditions
- 3: Error — Error conditions
- 4: Warning — Warning conditions
- 5: Notice — Normal but significant conditions
- 6: Informational — Informational messages
- 7: Debug — Debug-level messages

	The rsyslog service uses the cacility and priority of log messages to detemine how th handle them.

	this is configured by rules in th /etc/rsylog.conf file.
	systemctl restart resyslog.service : restart service to apply the modification.

	
	log file rotation 
		the logrotate tool rotates log fils to keep them form taking up too much space in the file system containing the /var/log directory.
		/etc/logrotate.conf : Main configuration file,
		systemcl restart logrotate.service 

	sending Syslog  Messages Manually 
		the Logger command can send messages to the rsyslog service.By default, it sends the message to the user facility with hte notice priority(user.notice) unless specified otherwise with the -p option.


	Reviewing System Journal Entries 
		the gournalctl commadn highlights important kog maessages: messages at notice or warning priority are in bold text while messages at the error priority or higher are in red text.

		journalctl -n :by default -n show the last 10 log Entries.
			 	   -f :
				   -p <priority> : list journal Entries at the <priority> or higher.
				   -b : Display boat logs 
				   --since yesterday : 
				   _PID=1 : Display logs for user his UID = 1


		make journalctl logs permanent:
			mkdir /var/log/journal
			chown -R root:system-journal /var/log/journal

			shmod g+s /var/log/journal
			vi /etc/systemd/journal.conf
				uncomment Storage 
				Storage=persistent
				:wq : save changes
			systemctl restart systemd-journal

	Maintaining Accurate Time.
		timedatectl command shows an overview of the currnet time-related system settings.including currnt time, zone, and NTP synchroniztion settings of the system.
		
		timedatectl : 
		timedatectl list-timezones : lsited time zones
		timedatectl set-timezones Africa/Cairo : set time zone
		
		tzselect : detemine the appropriate time zone

		timedatectl set-time <YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss>: to change the system's current time.


=============Networking ===============


goal 
	configure network interfaces and settings on Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers.

Objectives 
	Configure and modify network Settings from the CLI.
	Manage network settings and devices using  nmcli.
	Troubleshoot connectivity issues using CLI commands.
	Change a server's host name and the DNS configurations form the CLI.


Gathering network interface Information

	Identifuing Network Interfaces 
		ifconfig : this program is obslete! for replacement chech ip addrand ip link. for staticsics
		use ip -s link.
		ip link : list all network interfaces available on your system.
		ip  add  show : get more about IP address Information.
		ping  : send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts 
			 -c : Stop after sending count ECHO_REQUEST packets.
		
		ip route : display default ip rotute.

	Cheching connectivity between hosts.
		Tracing Routes Taken by Traffic.
		traceroute or tracepath : to trace the path that network traffic to reach a remote host through myltiplerouters.

	Troubleshoot paorts and serviices 
		TCP services use sockets as end points for communication and are made up of an IP address, protocol, and port number.

		/etc/services : file contains a list of network services and ports mapped to them.

		ss : used to display socket staticsics.
			-n :show numbers instead of names for interfaces and ports.
			-t show TCP soockets.
			-u Show UDP sockets.
			-l show only listing sockets.
			-a show all (listeing and established)sockets.
			-p show the process using the sockets.

	configure Network form the command listeing
		RHEL8
			sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<YNIN>: Create this file if it doesn’t exist, replacing YNIN with your network interface name.
			Edit the following contents to fit your network addressing scheme and paste into the file.

				DEVICE=<Your network interface name>
				TYPE=Ethernet
				NM_CONTROLLED=yes
				ONBOOT=yes
				BOOTPROTO=none
				IPADDR=192.168.121.188
				NETMASK=255.255.255.0
				GATEWAY=192.168.121.1
				DNS1=8.8.8.8
				DNS2=4.2.2.2
				IPV6INIT=no
				USERCTL=no
				PEERDNS=yes
		RHEL9
			say goodbye to ifcfg-files,and hello to key files
			
			nmcli : this command can be used to modify the network congiuration.
			network configuration will be written to files tin the /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ directory
			The old network-scripts package has been removed which means you'll not find anyting in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts directory.

		view network Information
			 nmcli dev status : displays the status of all network devices.

			 nmcli con show : displays a lsit of all connections. to list only the active connectiions, add the --active option
		
		adding a network connection 
			nmcli con add used to add new network connectiions.

				nmcli connection add con-name <Static-connectiion> type <ethernet> ifname <interface> ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.55/24
				gw4 192.168.1.1 connection.autoconnect yes ipv4.method manual : static connection

				nmcli connection add con-name Dynamic-<interface> ifname <interface> autoconnect yes ipv4.method auto : Dynamic connectiion

				nmcli connection up <con-name> : activate connectiion (Only one connection can be activated.)

				nmcli connection down <con-name> : deactivate connection 

				nmcli connection delete <con-name> : delete connection

				nmcli connection disconnect <con-name> : dispconnect connection
				
				nmcli connection connect <con-name> : connect connection
	Modifying network connection setting 
		nmcli con mod <con-name> : used to chage the settings for a connection.
			nmcli con mod <con-name> ipv4.addresses "192.0.2.2/24 192.0.2.254" : set the IPv4 address to 192.0.2.2/24
			and deflut geteway to 192.0.2.254 for the connection <con-name>.

		Who can modify network setting
			The root usr can make any necessary network configuration changes with nmcli.
	
				nmcli gen permissins : to see what your current permissions are.
			
		edit network configuration Files
			By default, changes made with nmcli con mod name are automatically saved to 
				/ect/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-name (RHEL8)
				/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/name.nmconnection (RHEL9)


			it is also plssible to configure network by directly editing the connection configuration files.
				/ect/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-name or /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/name.nmconnection 

				nmcli con reload : after doing so, reload network manager reads the configuration changes.

				what if nmcli con reload doesn't work?
					nmcli con down <"con-name"> : disconnect connection
					nmcli con up <"con-name"> connect connection

			also you can use nmtui 
				nmtui : run text user interface 

	configure Host Names and Name Resolution
		host name sotred in /ect/hostname

		hostname : Display host name

		hostnamectl : used to modify thsi file and may be used to view the status of the system's fully qualified host name.
			hostnamectl status : viwe the status of the system's fully qualified host name.
			hostnamectl set-hostname <newhostname> : change host name 


		configuring name Resolution
			the DNS resolver is used to convert hsot names to IP addresses or the reverse. It determines where to look based on the 
			configuration of the /etc/nsswitch.conf file.
			by defalut, the contents of the /etc/hosts file are checked first.

			if an entry os not found in the /etc/hosts file, by defalut the stub resolver to lok up the hostname by using a DNS nameserver. 
			the /etc/resolv.conf file controls how this query is perfromed.
		
			nmcli con mod <con-name> ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8 : add google DNS
			nmcli con down <con-name> 
			nmcli con up <con-name> 
			
			cat /ect/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<con-name> (RHEL8)
			cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<con-name> (RHEL9)
