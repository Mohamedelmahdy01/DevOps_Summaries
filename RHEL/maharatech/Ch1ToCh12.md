# Linux Commands and Concepts with Examples

## File System and Directory Management

### 1. **Listing Files**
- `ls -ltr`: Lists files in the current directory sorted by modification time, in reverse order.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    ls -ltr
    ```
    Output shows files with the latest modification time at the bottom.

### 2. **Create Directories**
- `mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3`: Creates directories `dir1`, `dir2`, and `dir3` in a nested structure.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p project/src/components
    ```

## Links in Linux

### 3. **Hard Link**
- `ln <file> <hardlink>`: Creates a hard link, which is another name for a file referring to the actual data.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    ln original_file hard_link_file
    ```
    Now `hard_link_file` points to the same data as `original_file`.

### 4. **Soft Link (Symbolic Link)**
- `ln -s <file> <softlink>`: Creates a soft link, which is a pointer to another file (similar to Windows shortcuts).
    - Example:
    ```bash
    ln -s /path/to/original_file soft_link_file
    ```

### 5. **View Inode Numbers**
- `ls -li`: Lists files along with their inode numbers.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    ls -li
    ```
    Output shows inode numbers in the first column.

## Pattern Matching

### 6. **Wildcards**
- `*`: Matches any string of zero or more characters.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    ls *.txt
    ```
    Lists all files ending with `.txt`.

- `?`: Matches any single character.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    ls file?.txt
    ```
    Lists files like `file1.txt`, `fileA.txt` but not `file12.txt`.

- `[abc...]`: Matches any one character within the brackets.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    ls [abc]*.txt
    ```
    Lists files starting with `a`, `b`, or `c` and ending with `.txt`.

## Basic Regular Expressions

### 7. **Common Regex Operators**
- `.`: Matches any character.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    grep 'a.b' file.txt
    ```
    Finds occurrences of `a`, any character, and `b` in `file.txt`.

- `^`: Matches the start of a string.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    grep '^start' file.txt
    ```
    Finds lines starting with `start` in `file.txt`.

- `$`: Matches the end of a string.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    grep 'end$' file.txt
    ```
    Finds lines ending with `end` in `file.txt`.

## File Operations

### 8. **Cut Command**
- `cut -d <delimiter> -f <fields> <file>`: Extracts specific fields from a file.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    cut -d: -f1,7 /etc/passwd
    ```
    Extracts the 1st and 7th fields from `/etc/passwd`, using `:` as the delimiter.

### 9. **Word Count (wc)**
- `wc <file>`: Counts words, lines, and characters in a file.
    - Example:
    ```bash
    echo "I Love Linux" | wc
    ```
    Output: `1 3 13`, meaning 1 line, 3 words, and 13 characters.

## Vim Basics

### 10. **Basic Navigation**
- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`: Move left, down, up, and right, respectively.
- `w`: Jump to the beginning of the next word.
- `b`: Jump to the beginning of the previous word.

    - Example:
    Open a file in Vim and use `w` to move forward through words.

### 11. **Editing Commands**
- `i`: Enter insert mode before the cursor.

### System Logging Overview:
Processes and the operating system kernel record events in logs. These logs are stored as text files, primarily in the `/var/log` directory. System logging is handled by two key services:

#### 1. **systemd-journald:**
   - A component of systemd responsible for recording, storing, and managing logs. 
   - Stores logs in a binary format at `/run/log/journal/`.
   - Supports querying logs using the `journalctl` command for more advanced filtering and management.

#### 2. **rsyslog:**
   - Sorts and writes system logs to files in `/var/log`, which persist across reboots.
   - Handles traditional text-based logging for persistent storage.
  
##### Common Log Files:
- **/var/log/messages:** General system messages.
- **/var/log/secure:** Security and authentication logs.
- **/var/log/maillog:** Mail server-related logs.
- **/var/log/cron:** Logs related to cron jobs.
- **/var/log/boot.log:** Logs related to system startup.

### Overview of Syslog Priorities:
Syslog messages have two components: facility and severity.

- **Facility:** The origin of the message, such as kernel, mail, authentication.
- **Severity Levels:** Range from 0 (Emergency) to 7 (Debug), where lower numbers indicate higher severity.

Logs can be analyzed using tools like `journalctl`, `grep`, and `rsyslog`.

In system administration, analyzing and storing logs is a critical task for monitoring and troubleshooting. Here's an overview of syslog priorities and how logs are typically handled:

### Overview of Syslog Priorities

Syslog (System Logging Protocol) is widely used in Unix-like operating systems (like Linux) for collecting and storing log messages from various system components. Each log message has a priority, which is a combination of *facility* and *severity level*.

#### 1. **Facility:**
Facilities represent the part of the system or application that generates the log message. Common facilities include:

- **kern:** Kernel messages
- **user:** User-level messages
- **mail:** Mail system
- **daemon:** System daemons (background processes)
- **auth:** Security/authorization messages
- **syslog:** Syslog itself
- **local0-local7:** Reserved for local use

#### 2. **Severity Levels:**
Severity levels indicate the importance of the log message. The lower the number, the higher the severity:

- **0: Emergency** â€” System is unusable
- **1: Alert** â€” Immediate action needed
- **2: Critical** â€” Critical conditions
- **3: Error** â€” Error conditions
- **4: Warning** â€” Warning conditions
- **5: Notice** â€” Normal but significant conditions
- **6: Informational** â€” Informational messages
- **7: Debug** â€” Debug-level messages

#### Syslog Message Structure:
The priority of each message is calculated by combining the facility and severity, where:

```
Priority = (Facility * 8) + Severity
```

### Analyzing Logs:
Logs can be analyzed manually or using tools like:
- **grep:** To search logs for specific patterns or errors.
- **tail -f /var/log/syslog:** For real-time log monitoring.
- **journalctl:** To query and filter system logs (for systems using `systemd`).

### Storing Logs:
Logs are typically stored in files under `/var/log`. Examples include:
- `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` for general system logs
- `/var/log/auth.log` for authentication-related logs
- `/var/log/dmesg` for kernel ring buffer messages

You can also configure remote logging, centralizing logs across multiple servers using tools like:
- **rsyslog**: Advanced logging with features like filtering, remote logging, and custom formatting.
- **Logrotate**: For managing the size and rotation of log files.

#### Best Practices:
- Set up log rotation to avoid disk space issues.
- Use central logging solutions for distributed environments.
- Implement monitoring for high-priority logs (errors, critical, alert).
