# 🔐 SSH & 🖥️ SSHd Service Explained

## 1️⃣ What is SSH?

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a 🔐 network protocol for securely accessing & managing 🌐 systems, such as Linux servers, cloud environments, network devices, and virtual machines, over an unsecured network. It 🔒 data, authenticates 🙋, & ensures secure communication between 💻 & 🖥️. Common uses include:

- 🖥️💻 Remote command-line login (`ssh user@host`)
- 📂 Secure file transfers (`scp`, `sftp`)
- 🔗 Tunneling services & forwarding ports securely

**Necessity for SysAdmins:**\
SSH is **essential** for 🔒 remote server management, auditing, & automation. Without it, sysadmins would rely on insecure protocols like Telnet or FTP.

## 2️⃣ How Does SSH Work?

1️⃣ **Connection Initiation:** The client (`ssh`) initiates a connection to the server (`sshd`).
2️⃣ **Key Exchange:** The client & server negotiate 🔐 algorithms & exchange cryptographic 🔑 to establish a secure session.
3️⃣ **Authentication:**

- 🔑 **Password-based:** User enters a password (less secure).
- 🗝️ **Key-based:** Uses public-private key pairs (recommended).
- 🛡️ **MFA:** Optional, adds another security layer.
  4️⃣ **Secure Channel:** After authentication, all communication is encrypted.

**Necessity for SysAdmins:**\
Understanding this workflow is **critical** for troubleshooting 🔍 common issues such as authentication failures, connection timeouts, and permission errors, as well as hardening server 🛡️ security settings to prevent unauthorized access.

## 3️⃣ Create an SSH Key

Generate an SSH 🔑 pair using `ssh-keygen`:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

- `-t`: 🔑 type (e.g., `ed25519`, `rsa`).
- `-C`: Optional 💬 (e.g., email).

Keys are stored in `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (private 🔒) & `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (public 🗝️).\
**Always protect the private key with a strong passphrase.**

---

## 4️⃣ Copy SSH Key

Use `ssh-copy-id` to install the public key on the server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@remote-host
```

Or manually:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh user@remote-host "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

🔐 **Security Tip:** After setup, disable password authentication to enhance security by eliminating the risk of password-based brute-force attacks and credential theft. This ensures only systems with authorized SSH keys can gain access:

```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

## 5️⃣ Configuration Files

### 🖥️ Server-Side (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)

| Directive             | Purpose                     | Example | Necessity |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| `ClientAliveInterval` | ⏱️ Detect inactive sessions | `300`   | ✅         |
| `PermitRootLogin`     | 🚫 Restrict root login      | `no`    | 🚨        |
| `AllowUsers`          | 🙋 Restrict access to users | `aeid`  | ✅         |
| `Port`                | 🔢 Change default port      | `2222`  | ⚠️        |

### 💻 Client-Side (`~/.ssh/config`)

```config
Host remote-host
  HostName 192.168.1.100
  Port 2222
  User aeid
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

---

## 6️⃣ Troubleshooting 🛠️

- ❌ **Permission Denied (publickey):** Check file permissions with `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and ensure the correct private key is being used.
- ⏱️ **Connection Timeout:** Verify the SSH service is running using `sudo systemctl status sshd` and ensure the server is reachable over the network.
- ⚠️ **Host Key Verification Failed:** Resolve using `ssh-keygen -R host_ip` to remove outdated keys from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.
- 🔥 **Firewall Blocking SSH:** Confirm that port 22 (or custom SSH port) is open in firewall rules with `sudo ufw status` or `iptables -L`.
- 🌐 **DNS Resolution Issues:** Check if the hostname resolves correctly using `nslookup hostname` or `dig hostname`. Use IP addresses if DNS issues persist.
- 🔑 **Authentication Failures:** Ensure the public key is correctly placed in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` and that `sshd_config` settings like `PubkeyAuthentication` are enabled.

- ❌ **Permission Denied:** Check permissions `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- ⏱️ **Timeout:** Verify `sudo systemctl status sshd`
- ⚠️ **Host Key Issues:** `ssh-keygen -R host_ip`

## 7️⃣ Best Practices 🌟

- 🔄 Rotate SSH 🔑 regularly
- 🚫 Use `fail2ban` to block brute-force attacks
- 📋 Audit SSH configs periodically
- 🛡️ Enable MFA for extra security
- 👀 Monitor `/var/log/auth.log`

---

## ✅ Conclusion

SSH is 🔑 for sysadmins to manage 🖥️ securely. By following best practices such as key-based authentication, disabling password logins, and regularly auditing configurations, sysadmins can significantly strengthen overall system security, reducing vulnerabilities and safeguarding sensitive data. Follow best practices for robust 🔒 server access management.
