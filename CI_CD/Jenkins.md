# Introduction to CI/CD

CI/CD, which stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**, aims to streamline and accelerate the software development lifecycle. It enables teams to quickly integrate code changes, automatically test them, and deploy new features with minimal manual intervention.

---

## Overview

- **Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of automatically and frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository. With CI, developers commit code several times a day, triggering automated builds and tests that catch issues early and ensure that the codebase remains stable.
  
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)** automates the process of preparing code for production. It ensures that the codebase is always in a deployable state by running a series of automated tests and build steps. In continuous delivery, a manual trigger is usually required to deploy to production.
  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)** takes automation one step further by automatically releasing every change that passes the tests into the production environment without any manual steps.

Together, these practices create a **CI/CD pipeline** that supports agile development and enables development and operations teams to work together seamlessly.

---

## CI/CD Flow

A typical CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Source Code Management**:  
   Developers commit code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).

2. **Build**:  
   Automated systems compile the code into an executable format or container image.

3. **Automated Testing**:  
   A suite of tests—including unit, integration, and sometimes end-to-end tests—is executed to validate that the new code does not break existing functionality.

4. **Artifact Creation**:  
   Successful builds produce deployable artifacts such as binaries, packages, or Docker images.

5. **Deployment**:  
   - **Continuous Delivery**: Artifacts are automatically deployed to a staging environment and are ready for production, pending manual approval.
   - **Continuous Deployment**: Artifacts that pass all tests are automatically released into production.

6. **Monitoring and Feedback**:  
   Post-deployment, monitoring tools track application performance and health, providing feedback that can be used to improve future releases.

---

## Why is CI/CD Important?

CI/CD plays a vital role in modern software development by:

- **Reducing Risk**:  
  Frequent integration and automated testing catch issues early, reducing the risk of large-scale failures.

- **Increasing Efficiency**:  
  Automation minimizes manual processes, leading to faster and more reliable deployments.

- **Improving Code Quality**:  
  Continuous testing ensures that every code change is validated, maintaining high standards for the codebase.

- **Enhancing Responsiveness**:  
  Rapid feedback loops allow teams to quickly incorporate user feedback and release new features, keeping applications up-to-date and competitive.

- **Simplifying Complexity**:  
  Incremental updates are easier to manage and troubleshoot compared to large, monolithic releases.

---

## Continuous Integration (CI)

CI focuses on merging code changes into a shared repository regularly, which helps prevent the build-up of conflicts. Key elements include:

- **Automated Builds and Tests**:  
  Every code commit triggers a build process along with unit and integration tests to verify that the new changes work correctly.

- **Frequent Code Merges**:  
  Regular integration helps ensure that multiple developers can work on different features without conflicts.

- **Rapid Feedback**:  
  Immediate test results enable developers to fix issues as soon as they are introduced.

---

## Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment

- **Continuous Delivery**:  
  In this model, every change that passes automated tests is automatically prepared for production release. However, deployment to production requires a manual approval step. This ensures the codebase is always in a deployable state.

- **Continuous Deployment**:  
  This approach automates the entire process, so every change that passes all tests is immediately released into production. It requires a robust testing framework to ensure quality since there is no manual gate before production.

---

## CI/CD and DevOps

CI/CD is a cornerstone of the DevOps culture, which emphasizes close collaboration between development and operations teams. By automating the process from code commit to production deployment, CI/CD helps:

- **Accelerate Development Cycles**:  
  Automation shortens the time between code changes and live deployment, enabling rapid iteration.

- **Enhance Collaboration**:  
  Shared responsibility between teams improves communication and speeds up problem resolution.

- **Integrate Security**:  
  Security measures, such as automated vulnerability scans and compliance checks, can be built into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that code meets quality and security standards before reaching production.

---

## CI/CD Security

Security is a critical component of any CI/CD pipeline. Best practices include:

- **Automated Security Testing**:  
  Integrate vulnerability scanning and security checks early in the pipeline to detect and fix issues before deployment.

- **Access Controls and Secrets Management**:  
  Use encrypted storage and strict access permissions to protect sensitive data and credentials.

- **Shift-Left and Shift-Right Security**:  
  Implement security testing at every stage of the pipeline—from code integration to post-deployment monitoring—to ensure comprehensive protection.

---

## Common CI/CD Tools

There is a wide array of tools available to implement CI/CD pipelines, including:

- **Jenkins**:  
  A popular open-source automation server for building, testing, and deploying code.

- **GitLab CI/CD**:  
  An integrated solution that supports the entire CI/CD process within the GitLab ecosystem.

- **CircleCI, Travis CI, Bamboo**:  
  Cloud-based or self-hosted platforms that offer robust CI/CD functionalities.

- **Tekton Pipelines**:  
  A Kubernetes-native framework for creating cloud-native CI/CD pipelines.

- **Spinnaker**:  
  A continuous delivery platform designed for multi-cloud environments.

Additional tools for configuration management (like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet), containerization (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes) often complement CI/CD workflows, helping to create reproducible and scalable environments.

---

## Conclusion

CI/CD transforms the software development lifecycle by automating the integration, testing, and deployment processes. This automation reduces risks, improves code quality, and accelerates the delivery of new features and updates. By adopting CI/CD practices, teams can create more efficient workflows, respond faster to user feedback, and maintain a competitive edge in today’s fast-paced development landscape.

# Getting Started with Jenkins
 
This guide provides an in-depth overview of Jenkins—a powerful, open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). You'll learn how to navigate the Jenkins dashboard, create and manage jobs, incorporate dynamic variables, and handle file outputs—all within a Docker containerized environment.

## Introduction to the Jenkins Dashboard

After logging in with the default credentials (**admin/1234**—remember to change these for security), you'll land on the Jenkins dashboard. Here’s what you need to know:

- **New Item**: Use this option to create new jobs, pipelines, or multi-branch projects.
- **People**: Manage users, roles, and permissions to control access.
- **Build History**: View detailed logs and statistics from recent job executions, which is crucial for troubleshooting.
- **Manage Jenkins**: Access system configuration, security settings, plugin management, and credential storage.

**Note:** Jenkins runs inside a Docker container. This means all operations occur within container isolation, ensuring a consistent and reproducible environment.

## Creating Your First Jenkins Job

To create a job:

1. **Create a New Item**:  
   Click on **New Item** on the dashboard. Choose **Freestyle Project**, name it (e.g., "My First Job"), and click **OK**.

2. **Configure the Job**:  
   In the build section of the job configuration, add an **Execute Shell** build step. Enter a simple command like:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello World"
   ```
   This command prints "Hello World" to the console output when the job runs.

3. **Execution Context**:  
   Remember, Jenkins jobs execute within the Docker container. To inspect the container’s environment, use:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it jenkins bash
   ```
   This opens a bash shell inside the container, allowing you to explore its filesystem and environment.

## Using Dynamic Variables and Command Substitution

Jenkins jobs can dynamically generate output using shell variables and command substitution. For example, you can include a timestamp in your job’s output:
```bash
CURRENT_DATE=$(date)
echo "Current date/time: $CURRENT_DATE"
```
- **Command Substitution**: The syntax `$(command)` executes the command and replaces it with its output.
- **Dynamic Output**: Capturing and printing variables (like the current date and time) adds context to your build logs, making them more informative.

## Output Redirection and File Management

Managing file output within Jenkins is straightforward. You can redirect command outputs to files as shown below:
```bash
# Redirect output to a file (overwrites if the file exists)
echo "User: $(whoami)" > /tmp/user_info.txt

# Append additional information to the file
date >> /tmp/user_info.txt
```
- The `>` operator creates or overwrites the file.
- The `>>` operator appends data to the file without overwriting existing content.

**Important Considerations:**
- Files created in directories like `/tmp` exist only within the container’s filesystem.
- To persist files beyond the container’s lifecycle or access them from the host machine, use Docker volumes.
- To verify the file contents, you can run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it jenkins cat /tmp/user_info.txt
  ```


---

## Execute Bash Scripts from Jenkins

Jenkins can run shell scripts as part of its build steps, allowing you to automate tasks such as deployments, testing, and notifications.

### Steps to Execute a Bash Script

1. **Create the Bash Script**

   Create a script file (e.g., `greet.sh`) with the following content:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # greet.sh: A simple greeting script that takes two parameters.
   # $1: First name
   # $2: Last name

   if [ -z "$1" ] || [ -z "$2" ]; then
     echo "Usage: $0 <FirstName> <LastName>"
     exit 1
   fi

   echo "Hello $1 $2"
   ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `#!/bin/bash` specifies that the script should run using Bash.
     - The script checks if both parameters are provided and displays a usage message if not.
     - It then prints a greeting message using the passed parameters.

2. **Make the Script Executable**

   Set the executable permission on your script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x greet.sh
   ```

3. **Copy the Script to the Jenkins Container**

   Use Docker to copy the script into the Jenkins container’s filesystem:
   ```bash
   docker cp greet.sh jenkins:/tmp/greet.sh
   ```
   - **Tip**: If you frequently update your scripts, consider using Docker volumes to share files between the host and container.

4. **Configure the Jenkins Job**

   - In your Jenkins job configuration, add a build step that executes a shell command.
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     /tmp/greet.sh "Mohamed" "Elmahdy"
     ```
     or 
     ```bash
     NAME=Mohamed
     LASTNAME=Elmahdy
     /tmp/greet.sh $NAME $LASTNAME
     ```
   - **Note**: Replace `"Mohamed"` and `"Elmahdy"` with desired values or parameters passed from Jenkins.

5. **Troubleshooting and Testing**

   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it jenkins bash
     ```
     to open a shell inside the Jenkins container and manually test the script.
   - Check the job’s console output in Jenkins for logs and any error messages.

---

## Add Parameters to Jenkins Jobs

Adding parameters to your jobs allows for dynamic input, making your build processes more flexible and customizable.

### Creating String Parameters

1. **Enable Parameterization**

   - In the job configuration, check the option **"This project is parameterized"**.

2. **Add a String Parameter**

   - **Parameter Name**: `FIRST_NAME`
   - **Default Value**: `Mohamed`
   - **Description**: (Optional) Provide a description so users know what input is expected.

3. **Use Parameters in the Build Script**

   In your build step (Execute Shell), reference the parameter using environment variable syntax:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello ${FIRST_NAME}"
   ```
   - **Note**: Jenkins passes parameters as environment variables, making them accessible in scripts.

### Execution Flow

- When the job is triggered, Jenkins prompts the user to input or confirm parameter values.
- The script then uses the provided values, enabling dynamic behavior based on user input.

---

## Create List (Choice) Parameters

Choice parameters allow you to define a set of predefined options from which users can select.

### Configuration Steps

1. **Add a Choice Parameter**

   - **Parameter Name**: `LAST_NAME`
   - **Choices**:  
     ```
     Mahmoud
     Elmahdy
     Abdulkader
     ```
   - **Description**: (Optional) Explain what the choices represent.

2. **Use the Choice Parameter in the Script**

   In your shell command, reference the parameter:
   ```bash
   echo "Selected Last Name: ${LAST_NAME}"
   ```
   - **Behavior**:  
     - Jenkins displays a dropdown list with the specified choices.
     - The selected value is passed to the script via the environment variable `${LAST_NAME}`.

---

## Boolean Parameters & Conditional Logic

Boolean parameters provide a simple true/false option that can control the flow of your build scripts.

### Add a Boolean Parameter

1. **Configure the Boolean Parameter**

   - **Parameter Name**: `SHOW_DETAILS`
   - **Default Value**: Checked (interpreted as `true`)
   - **Description**: (Optional) Explain that this parameter toggles additional output.

2. **Implement Conditional Logic in the Script**

   Modify your script to react to the boolean parameter:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # greet_with_condition.sh: Greets only if SHOW_DETAILS is true.
   # $1: First name, $2: Last name, $SHOW_DETAILS: Boolean parameter
   NAME=$1
   LAST_NAME=$2
   SHOW_DETAILS=$3


   if [ "${SHOW_DETAILS}" = "true" ]; then
     echo "Hello $1 $2"
   else
     echo "Enable SHOW_DETAILS to view the full greeting."
   fi
   ```
   - **Usage Example**:
     - **True**: If `SHOW_DETAILS` is true, the output will be `Hello John Doe`.
     - **False**: If `SHOW_DETAILS` is false, the output will be `Enable SHOW_DETAILS to view the full greeting.`

   - **Note**: Jenkins converts boolean parameters to strings (`true` or `false`), so ensure your comparisons reflect that.

3. **Copy the Script to the Jenkins Container**

   Use Docker to copy the script into the Jenkins container’s filesystem:
   ```bash
   docker cp script.sh jenkins:/tmp/script.sh
   ```

4. **Configure the Jenkins Job**

   - In your Jenkins job configuration, add a build step that executes a shell command.
   - Use the command:
     ```bash
     /tmp/script.sh "Mohamed" "Elmahdy" false
     ```
     or 
     ```bash
     NAME=Mohamed
     LASTNAME=Elmahdy
     SHOW_DETAILS=false
     /tmp/greet.sh $NAME $LASTNAME $SHOW_DETAILS
     ```

---

## Key Points and Best Practices

- **Containerized Environment**:  
  All Jenkins operations occur within a Docker container, ensuring isolation and consistency across development and production environments.

- **Shell Integration**:  
  Jenkins fully supports Bash scripting. This allows you to execute complex shell commands, use dynamic variables, and perform real-time output redirection.

- **File Persistence**:  
  Use Docker volumes to share and persist files between the container and the host machine, ensuring that your build artifacts and logs are not lost when the container restarts.

- **Debugging**:  
  Always review the Jenkins console output after each job execution. It provides real-time feedback and detailed logs that are invaluable for troubleshooting.

- **Security and Maintenance**:  
  - Update default credentials and manage user permissions carefully.
  - Regularly update plugins and backup your Jenkins configuration to ensure a secure and reliable CI/CD environment.


- **Parameter Naming Conventions**
   - Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., `ENVIRONMENT` instead of `env`) to reduce ambiguity.
   
- **Error Handling in Scripts**
   - Validate parameters at the beginning of your script and provide usage instructions if needed.
   - Use exit codes to signal errors, making it easier to detect failures in the Jenkins job.

- **Default Values**
   - Set sensible default values to streamline user input and reduce errors during manual triggers.

- **Script Organization**
   - Include comments in your scripts for maintainability.
   - Consider modularizing common functions into separate scripts or functions.

- **Logging and Debugging**
   - Ensure your scripts produce detailed logs to help troubleshoot issues during job execution.
   - Regularly check Jenkins console output to verify that parameters are correctly passed and scripts execute as expected.

# Jenkins & Docker 
This guide explains how to integrate Jenkins with Docker and SSH to execute jobs on remote Docker containers. In this setup, you’ll work with two main containers:
- **Jenkins Container**: Runs the main CI/CD server.
- **Remote Host Container**: A CentOS-based SSH server used as the target for job execution.

Secure, passwordless SSH connections are established using SSH key authentication. Follow the steps below to set up and test this integration.

---

## 1. Create the Remote SSH Server Container

### 1.1 Dockerfile Configuration

Create a `Dockerfile` for your SSH server container. This container uses CentOS 7 (for compatibility) and sets up an SSH service:

```dockerfile
FROM centos:7

# Install OpenSSH Server and Clients
RUN yum install -y openssh-server openssh-clients

# Create a new user and set a password
RUN useradd remote_user && \
    echo "remote_user:1234" | chpasswd && \
    mkdir /home/remote_user/.ssh && \
    chmod 700 /home/remote_user/.ssh

# Copy the public SSH key into authorized_keys for passwordless authentication
COPY remote-key.pub /home/remote_user/.ssh/authorized_keys
RUN chown remote_user:remote_user /home/remote_user/.ssh -R && \
    chmod 600 /home/remote_user/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Generate SSH host keys and start the SSH daemon
RUN ssh-keygen -A
CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]
```

### Key Steps Explained:
- **SSH Installation**: Installs OpenSSH server/client packages.
- **User Creation**: A new user `remote_user` is created with password `1234`.
- **SSH Key Setup**:  
  - A public key (to be generated later) is copied into `authorized_keys` for secure, passwordless access.
  - Directory and file permissions are set to secure the SSH configuration.
- **Service Configuration**:  
  - Host keys are generated (`ssh-keygen -A`).
  - The container runs the SSH daemon in the foreground.

---

## 2. Set Up Docker Compose

Use Docker Compose to run both the Jenkins and remote host containers on an isolated network.

### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17
    networks:
      - net
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home

  remote-host:
    build:
      context: ./centos7   # Ensure the Dockerfile and remote-key.pub are in this directory
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: remote-host
    networks:
      - net

networks:
  net:

volumes:
  jenkins-data:
```

### Key Features:
- **Network Isolation**: Both containers are on the same Docker network (`net`), enabling communication.
- **Custom Build**: The remote host container is built from your custom Dockerfile.
- **Persistent Jenkins Data**: A Docker volume (`jenkins-data`) is used for Jenkins home directory persistence.

---

## 3. Configure SSH Key Authentication

### 3.1 Generate SSH Keys

Generate an RSA key pair on your host machine:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f remote-key
```
This command creates:
- `remote-key` (private key)
- `remote-key.pub` (public key)

### 3.2 Configure the Remote Host Container

If not already copied via Dockerfile, manually copy the public key into the container:
```bash
docker cp remote-key.pub remote-host:/home/remote_user/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Then, set appropriate permissions (if needed):
```bash
docker exec -it remote-host chmod 700 /home/remote_user/.ssh
docker exec -it remote-host chmod 600 /home/remote_user/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

---

## 4. Connect from the Jenkins Container

### 4.1 Test SSH Connection Manually

To verify the SSH connection, access the Jenkins container and attempt an SSH connection:
```bash
docker exec -it jenkins bash
ssh -i /tmp/remote-key remote_user@remote-host
```
*Note*: Ensure that the private key (`remote-key`) is copied into the Jenkins container at a suitable location (e.g., `/tmp/remote-key`) with secure permissions.

### 4.2 Jenkins Job Configuration

In your Jenkins job:
1. **Add SSH Credentials**:
   - **Username**: `remote_user`
   - **Private Key**: Paste the content of `remote-key` (do not commit your private key to version control).
   
2. **Configure the Build Step**:
   In the job’s shell build step, use a command like:
   ```bash
   ssh -i /var/jenkins_home/remote-key remote_user@remote-host "echo Hello World"
   ```
   Adjust the path to your private key if you stored it elsewhere.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

| **Issue**                 | **Solution**                                                                              |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CentOS Compatibility**  | Use the `centos:7` base image to avoid issues with newer CentOS versions.                 |
| **SSH Key Permissions**   | Ensure the private key has `600` permissions and the `.ssh` directory is set to `700`.     |
| **Connection Refused**    | Verify that both containers are on the same Docker network (`net`) and that SSH is running. |
| **Key Not Found**         | Confirm that the key file is in the correct location inside the Jenkins container.         |

### Key Commands for Verification:
```bash
# Build and start containers
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

# Access Jenkins container shell
docker exec -it jenkins bash

# Test network connectivity from Jenkins container
ping remote-host
```

## 6. Best Practices

- **Key Security**:  
  - Never commit private keys to version control.
  - Store keys securely and restrict permissions.
  
- **Network Isolation**:  
  - Use dedicated Docker networks to isolate service communication.
  
- **User Permissions**:  
  - Avoid using the root user for SSH connections; create specific users for automation.
  
- **Image Maintenance**:  
  - Regularly update base images and packages to include security patches.
  
- **Credential Management**:  
  - Use Jenkins’ credential management system to securely store and manage SSH keys.

## Installing Jenkins Plugins (SSH Plugin)

### Overview

To establish secure connections between Jenkins and remote hosts, you must install the SSH plugin. This plugin allows Jenkins to execute shell commands on remote machines over SSH.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Verify Internet Connectivity**
   - Ensure that your Jenkins container (or VM) has a working internet connection.
   - Test by running:
     ```bash
     ping -c 4 google.com
     ```
   - A successful ping confirms that Jenkins can reach external repositories.

2. **Access the Jenkins Plugin Manager**
   - **Log in to Jenkins Dashboard**: Open your Jenkins URL in a web browser and log in.
   - Navigate to **Manage Jenkins**.
   - Click on **Manage Plugins**. In the Plugin Manager, you will see several tabs:
     - **Installed Plugins**: Shows plugins currently in use.
     - **Available Plugins**: Shows plugins available for installation.
     - **Updates**: Lists plugins with available updates.

3. **Search and Install the SSH Plugin**
   - Under the **Available Plugins** tab, type “SSH” in the search box.
   - Locate the SSH plugin from the search results.
   - Check the box next to the SSH plugin and click **Install without restart** (or **Download now and install after restart** if prompted).
   - Wait for the plugin to download and install.
   - After installation, verify that the SSH plugin appears under the **Installed Plugins** tab.

## Integrating Your Docker SSH Server with Jenkins

### Overview

This section describes how to configure Jenkins to communicate with your Docker-based SSH server (the remote host). You will define the remote host details and set up the credentials required for secure, passwordless SSH connections.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Configure the Remote Host in Jenkins**
   - From the Jenkins dashboard, click on **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.
   - Scroll down to the section labeled **SSH remote hosts** (this may be within an SSH plugin-specific configuration section).
   - Click **Add** (or a similar button) to create a new remote host entry.
   - **Hostname**: Enter the internal hostname as defined in your Docker Compose file (e.g., `remote-host`).
   - **Port**: Enter the SSH port (default is `22`).

2. **Set Up Connection Details**
   - Specify any additional options such as connection timeout, retry count, and default remote directory if available.
   - These settings ensure that Jenkins can reliably connect even if there are minor network delays.

3. **Add Credentials (Username & Private Key)**
   - Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Global Credentials**.
   - Click **Add Credentials**.
   - Choose the **Username with private key** option.
   - **Username**: Enter the SSH username (e.g., `remote_user` as configured in your Dockerfile).
   - **Private Key**: Paste the content of your private key file (e.g., the content of `remote-key` generated using `ssh-keygen`).
   - Optionally, add a description (e.g., “SSH key for remote Docker host”).
   - Save the credentials.

4. **Test the Connection**
   - Return to the **Configure System** page under SSH remote hosts.
   - Select the newly added credentials.
   - Click **Check Connection** (or similar) to test if Jenkins can successfully connect to the remote host.
   - A successful test confirms that the configuration is correct.
   - Save the configuration once verified.

## Running a Jenkins Job on Your Docker Remote Host via SSH

### Overview

This section explains how to create and run a Jenkins job that executes commands on your Docker-based remote host through SSH. This allows you to offload tasks (such as deployments, file operations, or other maintenance tasks) to remote containers.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Create a New Jenkins Job**
   - From the Jenkins dashboard, click on **New Item**.
   - Enter a job name (e.g., `Remote_Task`) and select **Freestyle Project**.
   - Click **OK** to create the job.

2. **Configure the Job to Run Remote Commands**
   - In the job configuration page, scroll to the **Build** section.
   - Click on **Add build step** and choose **Execute shell script on remote host using SSH**.
     - This option should appear after installing the SSH plugin.
   - From the dropdown menus, select:
     - **Remote Host**: The one you configured earlier (e.g., `remote-host`).
     - **Credentials**: The SSH credentials you added (e.g., for `remote_user`).

3. **Specify the Command to Execute**
   - In the command text box, enter the shell command that should run on the remote host. For example:
     ```bash
     echo "Hello, my name is Jenkins. The current date and time is $(date)" > /tmp/remote_file
     ```
   - This command writes a message (including the dynamic output of `date`) to `/tmp/remote_file` on the remote host.

4. **Run and Verify the Job**
   - Save the job configuration.
   - Click **Build Now** to trigger the job.
   - Open the **Console Output** to monitor the execution and verify that the job ran successfully.
   - To confirm the remote command, access the remote host (e.g., via `docker exec -it remote-host bash`) and check that `/tmp/remote_file` contains the expected output.
