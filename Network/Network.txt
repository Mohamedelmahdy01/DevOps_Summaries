what is a computer network?


why Networks ?
    share hardware and data.

Network Advantages
    Save a lot of money
    Increase Workgoups collaboration
    Increase Productivity
    Protect Company Data

Network Components 
    Computer Systems
    Network Media
    Network Interface
    Network Protocol

Network topology
    Topology is the layout of the network

        ----> physical Topology:
    ----
        ----> Logicl Topology

The most common types of network topology 
    Bus Topology
    Ring Topology
    Mesh Topology
    Star Topology

    Advantages of Reference Models
        The OSk model divides network communication proecces intro 
        smaller adn simpler compontents, thus aiding Component 
        development, design, and troubleshooting.

        It allows multiple-vendor development through the standardization 
        of network components.

        It allows verious types of network hardware and software to communicate.

        Aids in troubleshooting.


    application layer
        Appliction : HTTP/FTP/SMIP
        presentation : Syntax, compression, Encryption
        Session : create sessions
    Transport layer   
        Transport : segmentation. (Segment)
        Network : routing, IP assigment. (Packet)
    Network ARchitecture layer 
        Data Link : LLC /MAC . (frame)
        Physical :  bits
