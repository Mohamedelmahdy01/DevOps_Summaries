A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, routers, etc.) that can share resources, exchange data, and communicate with each other. These devices are connected using communication protocols over wired or wireless media.

### Why Networks?
Networks allow for the sharing of hardware (like printers, scanners) and data, enabling easier collaboration and efficient use of resources. Key reasons for networks include:
- **Sharing hardware** and **data** to reduce costs.
  
### Network Advantages:
- **Cost-saving**: Reduces the need for redundant hardware.
- **Increased workgroup collaboration**: Enables teams to work together more effectively.
- **Boosts productivity**: Easier access to shared resources enhances efficiency.
- **Data protection**: Centralized management of sensitive data improves security.

### Network Components:
1. **Computer Systems**: Devices like PCs, servers, etc.
2. **Network Media**: Cables or wireless signals that facilitate data transfer.
3. **Network Interface**: Hardware (such as NICs) that allows systems to connect to the network.
4. **Network Protocol**: Rules and conventions (like TCP/IP) that dictate how data is transmitted and received.

### Network Types:
1. **Geographical Area**: Defines the size and scope of the network.
   - **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Covers a small area like a building.
   - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Spans a city or campus.
   - **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers large areas, often using satellite or leased lines.

2. **Host Role**: Defines how devices interact.
   - **P2P (Peer-to-Peer)**: All devices share resources equally.
   - **C/S (Client-Server)**: Centralized servers provide resources to clients.

### Network Topology:
- **Physical Topology**: The actual arrangement of cables and devices in a network (e.g., star, bus, ring topologies).
- **Logical Topology**: The way data flows within the network regardless of the physical layout (e.g., how signals travel).
