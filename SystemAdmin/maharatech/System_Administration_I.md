# **Managing Files from the Command Line in Linux**

## **1. Introduction**
Linux is built around a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to manage files, directories, and the file system. Mastering file management through the CLI helps improve efficiency and control over the system.

---

## **2. Access Linux File System**

Linux follows a hierarchical file system structure, starting from the root directory `/`. All files and directories are organized under this root.

### **Navigating the File System**
- **Current working directory**: To see your current directory:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- **Change directory**: Use the `cd` command to move between directories:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory   # Absolute path
  cd ..                   # Moves up one directory
  ```

---

## **3. Major Directories in Linux**
Here are some important Linux directories:
- **`/`**: Root directory of the file system.
- **`/home`**: Contains personal directories for users.
- **`/etc`**: Contains system configuration files.
- **`/var`**: Stores log files, spools, and temporary files.
- **`/usr`**: Stores user binaries, documentation, libraries, etc.
- **`/tmp`**: Stores temporary files created by programs.

---

## **4. Linux File Types**

In Linux, files can have different types:
- **Regular file (`-`)**: A standard file that contains data.
- **Directory (`d`)**: A folder that contains other files or directories.
- **Symbolic link (`l`)**: A link that points to another file or directory.
- **Character device (`c`)**: Used for serial data transmission, like a terminal.
- **Block device (`b`)**: Handles data in blocks, like hard drives.
- **Socket (`s`)**: Used for inter-process communication.
- **Pipe (`p`)**: A mechanism to communicate between processes.

---

## **5. Rules for Naming Linux Files**

- Case-sensitive: `File.txt` and `file.txt` are different files.
- Allowed characters: letters, numbers, periods (`.`), underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`).
- Avoid special characters: Avoid using characters like `*`, `?`, `/`, `\`, and `&`.
- Maximum filename length: Usually 255 characters.

---

## **6. Absolute Path vs Relative Path in Linux**

- **Absolute Path**: Starts from the root `/` and provides the full path to a file or directory.
  ```bash
  /home/mohamed/documents/file.txt
  ```

- **Relative Path**: Relative to your current working directory.
  ```bash
  ./documents/file.txt    # From current directory
  ../file.txt             # One level up
  ```

---

## **7. LS Command**

The `ls` command is used to list files and directories.

### **Common `ls` Options**
- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current directory.
- **`ls -l`**: List in long format with details like permissions, owner, size, etc.
- **`ls -a`**: List all files, including hidden files (those starting with `.`).
- **`ls -h`**: Display file sizes in human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).
- **`ls -R`**: Recursively list all files and directories.

---

## **8. Managing Files Using the Command Line**

### **Basic Commands**
- **Create file**: 
  ```bash
  touch file.txt    # Creates an empty file
  ```
- **View file**:
  ```bash
  cat file.txt      # Display file content
  ```
- **Delete file**:
  ```bash
  rm file.txt       # Remove file
  ```

---

## **9. Create & Copy Files and Directories**

### **Create Directories**
- **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir my_directory
  ```

### **Copy Files and Directories**
- **`cp`**: Copy files or directories.
  ```bash
  cp file.txt /path/to/destination   # Copy a file
  cp -r dir1 /path/to/destination    # Copy a directory recursively
  ```

---

## **10. Move & Remove Files and Directories**

### **Move Files**
- **`mv`**: Move or rename files and directories.
  ```bash
  mv file.txt /new/location          # Move file to new location
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt         # Rename a file
  ```

### **Remove Files and Directories**
- **`rm`**: Remove files or directories.
  ```bash
  rm file.txt                        # Remove a file
  rm -r directory                    # Remove a directory recursively
  ```

---

## **11. Hard Links vs Soft Links**

### **Hard Links**
- A hard link points directly to the fileâ€™s data blocks. Both the original file and hard link share the same inode.

### **Soft (Symbolic) Links**
- A soft link is like a shortcut to the file, referencing its location. It has its own inode and points to the original file path.

---

## **12. Linux Inodes**

An inode is a data structure that stores information about a file, like its size, owner, permissions, and location on the disk, but **not the filename**. A file's name and the inode number are linked through directory entries.

---

## **13. Creating Hard Links and Soft Links (Part 1)**

### **Hard Links**
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  ln source_file hard_link_name
  ```

### **Soft Links (Symbolic Links)**

  ```bash
  ln -s source_file soft_link_name
  ```

---

## **14. Creating Hard Links and Soft Links (Part 2)**

### **Creating and Viewing Links**
- **Creating Hard Link**:
  ```bash
  ln file.txt hardlink.txt
  ```
- **Creating Soft Link**:
  ```bash
  ln -s file.txt softlink.txt
  ```

- **List Links**:
  ```bash
  ls -l     # Shows links with 'l' symbol for symbolic links
  ```

---

## **15. Pattern Matching**

Pattern matching allows you to manipulate multiple files based on patterns.

### **Common Patterns**
- **`*`**: Matches any number of characters.
  ```bash
  ls *.txt      # List all .txt files
  ```
- **`?`**: Matches a single character.
  ```bash
  ls file?.txt  # Matches file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.
  ```

---

## **16. Grep Command**

The `grep` command is used to search for patterns in files.

### **Basic Usage**
```bash
grep "pattern" file.txt    # Search for 'pattern' in file.txt
grep -i "pattern" file.txt # Case-insensitive search
```

---

## **17. Using Regular Expressions with Grep**

Regular expressions (regex) allow advanced pattern matching in `grep`.

### **Common Regular Expressions**
- **`.`**: Matches any single character.
- **`^`**: Matches the start of a line.
- **`$`**: Matches the end of a line.
- **`[abc]`**: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.
- **`\d`**: Matches any digit.

```bash
grep "^Hello" file.txt   # Matches lines starting with 'Hello'
```

---

## **18. Cut and Tr Commands**

### **`cut` Command**

In Linux, files are the building blocks for data storage, configuration, and execution. Working with files is crucial for system administrators and developers. You can create, view, and edit files using a variety of tools like `touch`, `cat`, `echo`, and text editors like **Vim**.

### **Common File Commands**
- **Creating a file**:
  ```bash
  touch testfile.txt   # Creates an empty file
  echo "Hello World" > testfile.txt   # Creates a file with content
  ```
- **Viewing a file**:
  ```bash
  cat testfile.txt     # Displays content of the file
  less testfile.txt    # View file content in a paginated form
  ```
- **Editing a file**: 
  - Text editors like **Vim** or **Nano** can be used to modify files.
  ```bash
  vim testfile.txt
  nano testfile.txt
  ```

---

## **2. Input/Output Redirection**

Linux allows you to redirect the standard input (stdin), output (stdout), and error (stderr) of commands to files or other commands. This is helpful for managing outputs and saving logs.

### **Input Redirection (`<`)**
- Redirects input from a file to a command:
  ```bash
  command < inputfile
  ```

### **Output Redirection (`>`, `>>`)**
- **`>`**: Overwrites the content of a file with the output of a command.
  ```bash
  echo "New content" > outputfile.txt   # Overwrites file content
  ```
- **`>>`**: Appends the output of a command to a file without overwriting.
  ```bash
  echo "More content" >> outputfile.txt   # Appends to file
  ```

### **Error Redirection (`2>`, `2>>`)**
- Redirects standard error to a file.
  ```bash
  command 2> errorfile.txt     # Redirects errors to a file
  command 2>> errorfile.txt    # Appends errors to a file
  ```

---

## **3. Piping in Linux**

Piping allows the output of one command to be used as input to another command. It helps create complex commands by chaining simpler ones.

### **Pipe (`|`)**
- Combines commands:
  ```bash
  ls -l | grep "testfile"     # Passes the output of `ls -l` to `grep`
  ```
- Example:
  ```bash
  cat testfile.txt | wc -l    # Counts the number of lines in the file
  ```

## **6. Shell Variables (Part 1, 2, 3)**

Shell variables store data temporarily while the shell is running. Variables can store text, numbers, or the output of commands.

### **Defining and Accessing Variables**
```bash
MYVAR="Hello"         # Defines a variable
echo $MYVAR           # Accesses and prints the value of MYVAR
```

### **Part 1: User-Defined Variables**
- User-defined variables are created by the user and can hold any value.
  ```bash
  NAME="Mohamed"
  echo "Welcome $NAME"
  ```

### **Part 2: Environment Variables**
- Environment variables are system-wide and inherited by all processes.
  - Example: `$PATH`, `$HOME`
  ```bash
  echo $HOME     # Prints the user's home directory
  echo $PATH     # Prints the system's PATH variable
  ```

### **Part 3: Positional Parameters**
- Used in shell scripts to refer to script arguments.
  ```bash
  ./script.sh arg1 arg2
  echo "First argument: $1"
  echo "Second argument: $2"
  ```

---

## **7. Set and Unset Permanent Shell Variables**

- **Temporary Variables**: Exist only for the current session.
  ```bash
  VAR="temporary value"
  ```

- **Permanent Variables**: To make a variable permanent, add it to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.
  ```bash
  echo "export MYVAR='Hello World'" >> ~/.bashrc   # Adds variable to .bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc                                # Applies the changes
  ```

- **Unset Variables**: Removes a variable from the environment.
  ```bash
  unset MYVAR    # Unsets MYVAR
  ```

---

## **8. Summary**

- **Creating Files**: Use `touch`, `echo`, or text editors to create files.
- **Viewing Files**: Use `cat`, `less`, and `more` to display content.
- **Editing Files**: Editors like Vim allow you to modify files.
- **Redirection**: Redirect input/output using `>`, `>>`, and `<`.
- **Piping**: Chain commands together with `|`.
- **Vim**: A robust text editor with multiple modes for efficient text editing.
- **Shell Variables**: Store and manage temporary or permanent data in shell scripts.


# **Managing Local Users and Groups in Linux**

Linux organizes users into categories like superusers, system users, and regular users. Each user has a specific User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) associated with them. Proper management of users and groups is crucial for security and system functionality.

## **User Categories:**
1. **Superuser (root)**: UID 0.
2. **System Users**: Static (UID 1-200) and Dynamic (UID 201-999).
3. **Regular Users**: UID 1000 and above.

## **Basic Commands**

- **whoami**: Displays the effective user.
  
- **Difference between `su` and `su -`**:
  - `su <username>`: Switches the user without changing the current working directory.
  - `su - <username>`: Switches the user and changes to their home directory.

## **sudo Privileges**

- **sudo**: Allows permitted users to run commands as the superuser or another user.
  - In many systems, the root user might not have a valid password for security reasons.
  - If a user tries to run a command without permission, it will be blocked, logged, and an email may be sent to the root user (log stored in `/var/log/secure`).

### **sudo Configuration File:**
- **/etc/sudoers**: Main configuration file for managing sudo access.
  - Use `visudo` to safely edit this file:
    ```bash
    visudo
    ```
  - Examples:
    ```bash
    user01 ALL=(ALL) ALL     # Grant full sudo access to user01
    %group01 ALL=(ALL) ALL   # Grant full sudo access to group group01
    ```

## **Managing Users**

### **Adding Users**
- **useradd**: Adds a new user with various options.
  ```bash
  useradd <username>
  useradd -md /home/user_1 -c "Planning user" -s /bin/sh -g mohamed -G wheel -u 5000 user01
  ```
  - `-m`: Create the user's home directory.
  - `-d`: Specify home directory path.
  - `-c`: Comment field (usually for user descriptions).
  - `-s`: Specify the user's default shell.
  - `-g`: Primary group.
  - `-G`: Secondary groups.
  - `-u`: User ID.

### **Modifying Users**
- **usermod**: Modify existing users.
  ```bash
  usermod <username>
  usermod -c "Another comment" user01
  usermod -aG mohamed user01     # Add user to a secondary group
  usermod -L mohamed             # Lock user account
  usermod -U mohamed             # Unlock user account
  usermod -s /sbin/nologin mohamed  # Set shell to nologin (disables login)
  ```

### **Deleting Users**
- **userdel**: Delete users.
  ```bash
  userdel <username>           # Delete user without removing their home directory
  userdel -r <username>        # Delete user and their home directory
  ```

## **Managing Groups**

### **Adding Groups**
- **groupadd**: Adds a new group.
  ```bash
  groupadd -g 3000 group01    # Create a group with a specific GID
  ```

### **Modifying Groups**
- **groupmod**: Modify existing groups.
  ```bash
  groupmod -n newgroup group01  # Rename group
  ```

### **Deleting Groups**
- **groupdel**: Delete a group.
  ```bash
  groupdel group01
  ```

# **Managing User Passwords**

In Linux, user passwords are stored in the `/etc/shadow` file, which contains important information for each user account.

### **Example Entry in `/etc/shadow`:**
```
user03:$6$CSsX...:17933:0:9999:7::18113:
```
The fields in this file are separated by colons and include:
1. **Username**: The account name.
2. **Encrypted Password**: The hashed password.
3. **Last Password Change**: The number of days since 1/1/1970 when the password was last changed.
4. **Minimum Days**: The minimum number of days between password changes.
5. **Maximum Days**: The maximum number of days the password is valid before it must be changed.
6. **Warning Period**: The number of days before expiration to warn the user.
7. **Inactive Period**: Days of inactivity before the account is locked.
8. **Expiration Date**: Days since 1/1/1970 after which the password expires.
9. **Reserved for future use**.

### **Configuring Password Aging**
Use `chage` to configure password expiration policies:
```bash
chage -m 0 -M 90 -W 7 -I 14 user03
```
- `-m`: Minimum number of days between password changes.
- `-M`: Maximum number of days the password is valid.
- `-W`: Warning days before the password expires.
- `-I`: Days of inactivity before the account is locked.

### Example:
```bash
chage -m 0 -M 90 -W 7 user03   # Password can be changed anytime, expires in 90 days, 7-day warning
``` 

This ensures that user accounts are secure and managed according to policy.
# **Controlling Access to Files**

In Linux, controlling file access and permissions is essential for system security and efficient multi-user environments. Files can have different types and permissions that determine who can read, write, or execute them.

## **File Types**

- **d**: Directory
- **-**: Regular file
- **c**: Character device file
- **b**: Block device file
- **l**: Symbolic link file
- **p**: Named pipe file

Example of file permissions:
```
-rwxr-x--- 1 root root 0 oct 31 11:06 test
```

## **Changing Permissions**

### **Symbolic Method**
Permissions are split into three categories for **user (u)**, **group (g)**, and **other (o)**. You can modify these permissions using symbols:

- **r**: Read permission
- **w**: Write permission
- **x**: Execute permission

Permissions are added or removed with:
- **+**: Add permission
- **-**: Remove permission
- **=**: Set exactly the specified permission

Example commands:
```bash
chmod u+r test  # Add read permission for the user
chmod g-w test  # Remove write permission for the group
chmod a+x test  # Add execute permission for all (user, group, others)
```

You can combine permissions:
```bash
chmod u+rwx, g=rx, o-w test
```

### **Numeric Method**
Permissions can also be changed using a numeric representation. Each set of permissions is represented by a number:

- **7**: Full permission (rwx)
- **6**: Read and write (rw-)
- **5**: Read and execute (r-x)
- **4**: Read only (r--)
- **3**: Write and execute (-wx)
- **2**: Write only (-w-)
- **1**: Execute only (--x)

Example command:
```bash
chmod 777 test  # Full permissions for everyone
```

## **Changing Ownership**

You can change the ownership of files and directories using the following commands:

- Change the owner of a file:
  ```bash
  chown mohamed file1
  ```

- Change both the owner and group:
  ```bash
  chown mohamed:mohamed file1
  ```

- Change only the group ownership:
  ```bash
  chown :mohamed file1
  chgrp mohamed file1
  ```

- Recursively change ownership for directories and their contents:
  ```bash
  chown -R root:root dir1
  ```

## **Special Permissions**

Special permissions add advanced features to files and directories:

- **setuid (u+s)**: Grants the fileâ€™s owner permissions when the file is executed.
- **setgid (g+s)**: Ensures that files created within a directory inherit the group ID of the directory.
- **sticky bit (o+t)**: Prevents users from deleting files in a directory unless they are the owner.

Symbolic method:
```bash
chmod u+s file    # Apply setuid
chmod g+s dir1    # Apply setgid to a directory
chmod o+t dir1    # Apply sticky bit to a directory
```

Numeric method (fourth preceding digit):
```bash
chmod 2770 dir1   # Apply setgid and full permission for the owner and group
```

## **Searching for Files**

- Search for a file's location:
  ```bash
  which <file>
  ```
- Search using a database:
  ```bash
  locate <file>
  ```
- Update the search database (required for `locate` to find newly created files):
  ```bash
  updatedb
  ```

## **Default File Permissions**

**umask** defines the default permissions for new files and directories. The umask value is subtracted from the default permissions (777 for directories, 666 for files).

- View the current umask value:
  ```bash
  umask
  ```

### **Default umask Values**:
- **root**: `0022` (results in `755` permissions for directories and `644` for files)
- **regular users**: `0002` (results in `775` for directories and `664` for files)

### **Setting umask**:
- Set a new umask:
  ```bash
  umask 007
  ```

- **Umask Calculation Example**:
  - If the umask is `0022`:
    - Directory: `777` - `022` = `755` (`rwxr-xr-x`)
    - File: `666` - `022` = `644` (`rw-r--r--`)
  - If the umask is `0007`:
    - Directory: `777` - `007` = `770` (`rwxrwx---`)
    - File: `666` - `007` = `660` (`rw-rw----`)

### **Persistent umask**:
To make the umask setting permanent for the current user, add it to `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

```bash
echo "umask 007" >> ~/.bashrc
```

- **.bashrc**: Executed every time a new shell is opened.
- **.bash_profile**: Executed once when you log in.

By mastering file types, permissions, ownership, and special permissions, you can manage access control effectively in a Linux system.

# **Monitoring and Managing Linux Processes**

In Linux, a **process** is an instance of a running executable program. Each process is assigned a **Process ID (PID)**, and every process has a **Parent Process ID (PPID)**, which represents the parent process that created it.

## **Basic Commands for Process Management**

1. **Identify the User**:
   - Display the current effective user:
     ```bash
     whoami
     ```

2. **Process Listing**:
   - List current running processes:
     ```bash
     ps
     ```
   - Display all processes, including those without a controlling terminal:
     ```bash
     ps aux
     ```
   - A long listing with more technical details:
     ```bash
     ps lax
     ```
   - Interactive process viewer similar to Task Manager in Windows:
     ```bash
     top
     ```
   - Show processes in a tree structure:
     ```bash
     pstree
     ```
   - Show processes as a tree with their PIDs:
     ```bash
     pstree -p
     ```
   - Display processes of a specific user:
     ```bash
     pstree -p mohamed
     ```

3. **Find Specific Processes**:
   - Show process names for a specific user:
     ```bash
     pgrep -u mohamed -l
     ```

## **Managing Background and Foreground Processes**

1. **Running Processes in the Background**:
   - Run a command in the background:
     ```bash
     <command> &
     ```
   - List processes running in the background:
     ```bash
     jobs
     ```

2. **Bringing Processes to the Foreground**:
   - Bring a background process to the foreground:
     ```bash
     fg %<job number>
     ```

## **Killing and Stopping Processes**

1. **Killing a Process**:
   - Kill a process by PID:
     ```bash
     kill <PID>
     ```
   - List all available kill signals:
     ```bash
     kill -l
     ```
   - Default termination signal (SIGTERM):
     ```bash
     kill -15 <PID>
     ```
   - Forcefully terminate a process (SIGKILL):
     ```bash
     kill -9 <PID>
     ```
   - Reload configuration without terminating the process (SIGHUP):
     ```bash
     kill -1 <PID>
     ```

2. **Finding and Killing Processes**:
   - Find the PID of a process by name:
     ```bash
     pidof <process_name>
     ```
   - Kill all instances of a process by name:
     ```bash
     killall sleep
     ```
   - Kill all processes of a specific user:
     ```bash
     pkill -U mohamed
     ```

## **Monitoring and Scheduling Processes**

1. **Monitoring System Processes with `top`**:
   - View dynamic information about system processes:
     ```bash
     top
     ```
   - Limit the number of updates:
     ```bash
     top -n 2
     ```
   - Set the delay between updates (in seconds):
     ```bash
     top -d 2
     ```

2. **Process Scheduling and Priorities**:
   - List processes with their **nice** values (priority levels):
     ```bash
     ps lax | less
     ```
   - Show user, PID, nice value, and command:
     ```bash
     ps axo user,pid,nice,command
     ```

3. **Setting Process Priorities with `nice`**:
   - Start a process with a defined priority (default is 10):
     ```bash
     nice vim text
     ```
   - Start a process with a custom priority (e.g., 10):
     ```bash
     nice -n 10 vim text &
     ```

4. **Changing Process Priorities with `renice`**:
   - Change the priority of a running process:
     ```bash
     renice <nice_value> <PID>
     ```
   - Set the priority of all `sleep` processes to 19 (lowest priority):
     ```bash
     renice 19 $(pgrep sleep)
     ```

By mastering these commands, you can efficiently monitor, manage, and schedule processes in Linux, ensuring system resources are used effectively.


# **Controlling Services and Daemons in Linux**

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, **systemd** is the first process that starts (PID 1), managing all other system services and processes.

### **Common `systemctl` Commands**

1. **Listing Services**:
   - To list all active services:
     ```bash
     systemctl list-units --type=service
     ```
   - To list all active and inactive services:
     ```bash
     systemctl list-units --type=service --all
     ```
   - To list failed services:
     ```bash
     systemctl --failed --type=service
     ```

2. **Viewing Service Status**:
   - To check the status of a specific service (e.g., `sshd`):
     ```bash
     systemctl status sshd.service
     ```

3. **Service State Queries**:
   - Check if a service is active:
     ```bash
     systemctl is-active sshd.service
     ```
   - Check if a service is enabled to start at boot:
     ```bash
     systemctl is-enabled sshd.service
     ```
   - Check if a service has failed:
     ```bash
     systemctl is-failed sshd.service
     ```

### **Managing Services**

1. **Starting and Stopping Services**:
   - Start a service:
     ```bash
     systemctl start sshd.service
     ```
   - Stop a service:
     ```bash
     systemctl stop sshd.service
     ```
   - Restart a service:
     ```bash
     systemctl restart sshd.service
     ```

2. **Reloading a Service**:
   - Reload a service to re-read its configuration file without stopping it:
     ```bash
     systemctl reload sshd.service
     ```

3. **Managing Service Startup at Boot**:
   - Enable a service to start at boot:
     ```bash
     systemctl enable sshd.service
     ```
   - Disable a service from starting automatically at boot:
     ```bash
     systemctl disable sshd.service
     ```

### **Masking and Unmasking Services**

- **Masking** a service prevents it from being started (either manually or automatically):
   ```bash
   systemctl mask sendmail.service
   ```

- **Unmasking** a service re-enables it:
   ```bash
   systemctl unmask sendmail.service
   ```

### **Additional Commands**

1. **Listing Service Dependencies**:
   - To display a hierarchy of service dependencies:
     ```bash
     systemctl list-dependencies <unit>
     ```
   
By mastering these `systemctl` commands, you can control, monitor, and manage services and daemons effectively on a Linux system.

# **Configuration and Securing SSH**

### **Basic SSH Usage**

1. **SSH for Remote Interactive Shell**:
   - The command below opens a remote interactive shell on a remote system.
   
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@<remotehost>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   ssh student@serverb
   ```

2. **SSH Command Execution without Interactive Shell**:
   - You can use SSH to execute a command on the remote system without accessing the interactive shell.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   ssh <student>@<serverb> hostname
   ```
   This command runs the `hostname` command on the remote system as the `student` user.

3. **Execute Multiple Commands Remotely**:
   - Execute a series of commands without an interactive shell:
   
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@<remotehost> 'date; ls -lh'
   ```

---

### **Types of SSH Authentication**

There are two main types of authentication in SSH:

1. **Password Authentication**:
   - Requires the user to enter their password to access the remote system.

2. **Key-Based Authentication**:
   - A more secure method involving a key pair: a **private key** and a **public key**.

---

### **Generating SSH Key Pair**

- To generate a key pair, use the `ssh-keygen` command:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```

   - The keys are saved in your `~/.ssh/` directory:
     - **Private key**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
     - **Public key**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

   **File Permissions**:
   - The private key must have permissions set to `600`:
     
     ```bash
     chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     ```
   - The public key should have permissions `644`:

     ```bash
     chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```

---

### **Copying Public Key to Remote Server**

1. **Using `ssh-copy-id`**:
   - Automatically copies your public key to the remote system:

     ```bash
     ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mohamed@192.168.1.10
     ```

2. **Manually Copying the Public Key**:
   - If `ssh-copy-id` is not available, you can manually copy the key:

   1. **Copy the public key**:
      ```bash
      clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      ```
   
   2. **Access the remote server** and navigate to the `.ssh` directory:
      ```bash
      cd /root/.ssh
      ```

   3. **Add the public key** to the `authorized_keys` file:
      ```bash
      vi authorized_keys
      ```

   4. **Paste** the copied public key and save the file.

---

### **Customizing SSH Service Configuration**

The OpenSSH service is controlled by a daemon called **sshd**, and its main configuration file is located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

1. **Disabling Root Login**:
   - To enhance security, disable root login via SSH by modifying the `PermitRootLogin` setting in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
   
   ```bash
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```

2. **Disabling Password Authentication**:
   - To force users to authenticate using SSH keys and disable password authentication, modify the `PasswordAuthentication` setting:
   
   ```bash
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```

3. **Reloading the SSH Service**:
   - After making changes to the configuration file, reload the SSH service to apply the changes:
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload sshd.service
   ```

### **Note:**
- By default, SSH listens on **port 22**. You can change this by modifying the `Port` setting in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

# Analyzing and Storing Logs

### **Goal:**
- Locate and accurately interpret system logs to troubleshoot system events.

---

### **Objectives:**
1. **Describe the basic logging architecture in Red Hat Enterprise Linux**:
   - Learn how processes and the operating system kernel record events in log files located in `/var/log`.
   
2. **Understand the logrotate utility**:
   - Learn how log files are rotated to manage disk space, with the configuration in `/etc/logrotate.conf`.

3. **View and manage logs using `journalctl`**:
   - Use the `journalctl` command to filter and review logs, including prioritizing entries based on severity.

4. **Configure the time zone and adjust the system time**:
   - Manage system time settings, including time zone configuration using `timedatectl`.

---

### **System Logging Architecture**
- **Processes and Kernel Logging**:
   - Both processes and the Linux kernel log system events for auditing and troubleshooting.
   - Logs are stored in text files under `/var/log`.

- **Logging Services**:
   1. **systemd-journald**:
      - Manages system logs stored in binary format in `/run/log/journal/`.
      - Logs can be queried using `journalctl`.
   2. **rsyslog**:
      - Sorts and writes syslog messages to `/var/log`.
      - This persists logs across reboots.

- **Common Log Files**:
   - `/var/log/messages`: General system messages.
   - `/var/log/secure`: Security/authentication-related logs.
   - `/var/log/maillog`: Logs related to the mail server.
   - `/var/log/cron`: Logs related to scheduled job executions.
   - `/var/log/boot.log`: System startup logs.

---

### **Syslog Priorities Overview**
Syslog messages use **facility** and **priority** to determine how messages are handled. Messages have severity levels:

1. **0: Emergency** â€” System is unusable.
2. **1: Alert** â€” Immediate action needed.
3. **2: Critical** â€” Critical conditions.
4. **3: Error** â€” Error conditions.
5. **4: Warning** â€” Warning conditions.
6. **5: Notice** â€” Normal but significant conditions.
7. **6: Informational** â€” Informational messages.
8. **7: Debug** â€” Debug-level messages.

These priorities are managed by rules in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, and the `rsyslog` service is restarted to apply changes:
```bash
systemctl restart rsyslog.service
```

---

### **Log Rotation**
- **logrotate** is a tool used to rotate log files, preventing them from consuming too much space in `/var/log`.
   - The main configuration file is `/etc/logrotate.conf`.
   - Restart logrotate with:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart logrotate.service
   ```

---

### **Sending Syslog Messages Manually (Using `logger`)**
- The `logger` command can send syslog messages to `rsyslog`. By default, it logs messages as **user.notice**.
   ```bash
   logger "Custom syslog message"
   ```
   You can specify a different priority with the `-p` option:
   ```bash
   logger -p auth.err "Authentication error occurred"
   ```

---

### **Reviewing System Journal Entries (Using `journalctl`)**
- The `journalctl` command highlights important log messages:
   - **Bold**: Messages at **notice** or **warning** priority.
   - **Red**: Messages at **error** priority or higher.

   **Common `journalctl` commands**:
   - `journalctl -n`: Show the last 10 log entries.
   - `journalctl -f`: Continuously follow log output.
   - `journalctl -p <priority>`: Show logs at the specified priority or higher.
   - `journalctl -b`: Display logs from the current boot.
   - `journalctl --since yesterday`: Show logs starting from yesterday.
   - `journalctl _PID=1`: Display logs for a specific user by their UID (e.g., UID=1).

#### **Make `journalctl` Logs Permanent**:
1. Create the directory `/var/log/journal`:
   ```bash
   mkdir /var/log/journal
   chown -R root:system-journal /var/log/journal
   chmod g+s /var/log/journal
   ```
2. Edit `/etc/systemd/journal.conf`:
   - Uncomment `Storage` and set it to `persistent`:
   ```bash
   Storage=persistent
   ```
3. Restart `systemd-journald` to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart systemd-jjournald
   ```

---

### **Maintaining Accurate Time (Using `timedatectl`)**
- **timedatectl** shows an overview of current time settings, including time zone and NTP sync status.

   **Useful Commands**:
   - `timedatectl`: Displays time settings overview.
   - `timedatectl list-timezones`: Lists available time zones.
   - `timedatectl set-timezone Africa/Cairo`: Sets the time zone.
   - `timedatectl set-time <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>`: Manually set the system time.
   - `tzselect`: Guides you to determine the appropriate time zone.

### Installing and Updating Software Packages in RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)

---

#### **Goal**:  
Download, install, update, and manage software packages from RedHat and Yum Package repositories.

---

### **Explaining and Investigating RPM Software Packages**

RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) is a system for managing software on Linux systems. Package files have the following structure:
```
name-version-release-architecture.rpm
```
- **Name**: Describes the contents.
- **Version**: Version number of the software.
- **Release**: Release number of the package.
- **Architecture**: Processor type (e.g., `x86_64`, `noarch` for architecture-independent packages).

#### **Useful Commands for RPM**:
- **View OS Information**:
  - `hostnamectl` â€“ Track how the local system appears on the network.
  - `cat /etc/redhat-release` â€“ Show OS name and version.
  - `uname -a` â€“ Display OS details.

### **Creating Yum Repositories**

To manage packages using **Yum**, you need to configure repositories. Here's how to set up a local Yum repository from an ISO image:

1. **Mount the ISO image**:
   ```bash
   mount -o loop /dev/sr0 /mnt
   ```

2. **Create repository files**:
   Create `.repo` files under `/etc/yum.repos.d/` for both `AppStream` and `BaseOS`:
   ```bash
   vim /etc/yum.repos.d/AppStream.repo
   ```
   Contents:
   ```ini
   [Local_AppStream]
   name="RHEL9 Local AppStream repository"
   baseurl=file:///mnt/AppStream
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=0
   ```

   Similarly, create `BaseOS.repo`:
   ```bash
   vim /etc/yum.repos.d/BaseOS.repo
   ```
   Contents:
   ```ini
   [Local_BaseOS]
   name="RHEL9 Local BaseOS repository"
   baseurl=file:///mnt/BaseOS
   enabled=1
   gpgcheck=0
   ```

3. **Verify the repositories**:
   ```bash
   yum repolist
   ```

4. **Disable subscription warning**:
   Disable the subscription manager plugin:
   ```bash
   vi /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf
   ```
   Change:
   ```ini
   enabled=0
   ```

# **Accessing Linux File Systems**

### **Goal**
- Access, inspect, and use existing file systems on storage attached to a Linux server.

### **Objectives**
- List the block devices and file systems.
- Mount and unmount file systems and partitions in Linux.
- Search for files on mounted file systems using the `find` and `locate` commands.

---

## **File system and mount points**

- To make the contents of a file system available in the file-system hierarchy, it must be mounted on an empty directory.
- This directory is called a **mount point**. Once mounted, if you use the `ls` command to list that directory, you will see the contents of the mounted file system, and you can access and use those files normally.
- Many file systems are automatically mounted as part of the boot process.

---

## **Examining file systems**

- To get an overview of local and remote file system devices and the amount of free space available, run the `df` command.
  
  ```bash
  df       # report file system disk space usage
  df -h    # print sizes in human-readable format (powers of 1024)
  ```

- **`du`**: Shows the size of all files in the current directory tree recursively.

  ```bash
  du -h    # human-readable format
  ```

---

## **Identifying the block device**

- Use the `lsblk` command to list the details of a specified block device or all available devices.

  ```bash
  lsblk -fp   # lists file system type and provides more details
  ```

---

## **Mounting and unmounting file systems**

- There are two common ways to specify the file system on a disk partition for the `mount` command:
  1. With the name of the device file in `/dev` containing the file system.
  2. With the UUID written to the file system, a universally-unique identifier (UUID).

### **Examples**:

- **Mounting using the name of the device:**

  ```bash
  mount <blockname> <dirname>
  mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/data   # mounts /dev/vdb1 on /mnt/data
  mount /dev/nvme0n1p6 /data  # mounts /dev/nvme0n1p6 on /data
  ```

- **Mounting using UUID**:

  To get the UUID:

  ```bash
  lsblk -fd     # or blkid
  ```

  Then mount it using:

  ```bash
  mount UUID="<UUID>" <dirname>
  ```

- **Unmounting** a file system:

  ```bash
  umount <dirname>
  umount /data   # unmounts /data
  ```

- **Finding processes accessing a particular directory**:

  ```bash
  lsof /data    # shows processes using /data
  ```

- **`blkid`**: Prints block device attributes, such as UUIDs.


# **Searching for files on mounted file systems**

### **Locating files on the system**

A system administrator needs tools to search for files matching certain criteria on the file system. This section discusses two commands that can search for files in the file-system hierarchy:

1. **`locate`**: Searches a pre-generated index for file names or file paths and returns results instantly. It is fast because it looks up this information from the `mlocate` database.

   - However, this database is not updated in real time, so it must be frequently updated for results to be accurate.
   - The `locate` database is automatically updated every day, but the root user can manually update it by issuing the `updatedb` command.

#### **Examples**:

- **Locate** a file by name or path:

  ```bash
  locate file1          # searches for file1
  locate -i file1       # case-insensitive search
  locate -n 5 file1     # limit results to 5 entries
  ```

### **Searching for files in real time**

2. **`find`**: Performs a real-time search in the file-system hierarchy. It is slower than `locate` but more accurate. It can search for files based on various criteria, such as name, permissions, type, size, or modification time.

   - The `find` command searches files based on the account that executed the search. The user must have **read** and **execute** permissions on a directory to examine its contents.

#### **Examples**:

- **Search by name**:

  ```bash
  find <location> -name <filename>
  find / -name sshd_config            # searches for files named sshd_config starting from the / directory
  find / -name '*.txt'                # searches for all .txt files
  ```

- **Case-insensitive search by name**:

  ```bash
  find / -iname '*messages*'   # searches for files containing 'messages' in their names
  ```

- **Search by file owner**:

  ```bash
  find -user <username>
  find -user mohamed           # searches for files owned by mohamed
  ```

- **Search by group owner**:

  ```bash
  find -group <groupname>
  find -group mohamed          # searches for files owned by group mohamed
  ```

- **Search by user ID (UID)**:

  ```bash
  find -uid <uid>
  find -uid 1000               # searches for files owned by user with UID 1000
  ```

- **Search by file ownership and group**:

  ```bash
  find / -user root -group mail  # files owned by root and affiliated with group mail
  ```

---

## **Searching files based on permissions**

- The **`-perm`** option is used to search for files with a specific set of permissions, described as octal values (e.g., 764).

#### **Examples**:

- **Search for files with permissions 764**:

  ```bash
  find /home -perm 764
  ```

- **Search for files with at least specified permissions**:

  ```bash
  find /home -perm -324
  ```

---

## **Searching files based on size**

- Use the `-size` option with the `find` command, followed by a numerical value and the unit.
  
  **Units**:  
  - `k`: kilobyte  
  - `M`: megabyte  
  - `G`: gigabyte  

#### **Examples**:

- **Search for files of exactly 10 MB**:

  ```bash
  find / -size 10M
  ```

- **Search for files larger than 10 GB**:

  ```bash
  find / -size +10G
  ```

- **Search for files smaller than 10 KB**:

  ```bash
  find / -size -10k
  ```

- **Preallocate space for a file (1 GB)**:

  ```bash
  fallocate -l 1G file1
  ```

---

## **Searching files based on modification time**

- The **`-mmin`** option, followed by time in minutes, searches for files whose content was changed a certain number of minutes ago.  
  **Use `+`** for more than a certain time, and **`-`** for less than.

#### **Examples**:

- **Search for files modified exactly 120 minutes ago**:

  ```bash
  find / -mmin 120
  ```

- **Search for files modified more than 200 minutes ago**:

  ```bash
  find / -mmin +200
  ```

---

## **Searching files based on type**

- The **`-type`** option limits the search to a specific file type.  
  **Types**:  
  - `f`: regular file  
  - `d`: directory  
  - `l`: symbolic link  
  - `b`: block device

#### **Examples**:

- **Search for all directories in `/etc`**:

  ```bash
  find /etc -type d
  ```

- **Search for all symbolic links**:

  ```bash
  find / -type l
  ```

- **List all block devices in `/dev`**:
