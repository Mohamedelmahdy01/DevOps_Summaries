# **Managing Files from the Command Line in Linux**

## **1. Introduction**
Linux is built around a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to manage files, directories, and the file system. Mastering file management through the CLI helps improve efficiency and control over the system.

---

## **2. Access Linux File System**

Linux follows a hierarchical file system structure, starting from the root directory `/`. All files and directories are organized under this root.

### **Navigating the File System**
- **Current working directory**: To see your current directory:
  ```bash
  pwd
  ```
- **Change directory**: Use the `cd` command to move between directories:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/directory   # Absolute path
  cd ..                   # Moves up one directory
  ```

---

## **3. Major Directories in Linux**
Here are some important Linux directories:
- **`/`**: Root directory of the file system.
- **`/home`**: Contains personal directories for users.
- **`/etc`**: Contains system configuration files.
- **`/var`**: Stores log files, spools, and temporary files.
- **`/usr`**: Stores user binaries, documentation, libraries, etc.
- **`/tmp`**: Stores temporary files created by programs.

---

## **4. Linux File Types**

In Linux, files can have different types:
- **Regular file (`-`)**: A standard file that contains data.
- **Directory (`d`)**: A folder that contains other files or directories.
- **Symbolic link (`l`)**: A link that points to another file or directory.
- **Character device (`c`)**: Used for serial data transmission, like a terminal.
- **Block device (`b`)**: Handles data in blocks, like hard drives.
- **Socket (`s`)**: Used for inter-process communication.
- **Pipe (`p`)**: A mechanism to communicate between processes.

---

## **5. Rules for Naming Linux Files**

- Case-sensitive: `File.txt` and `file.txt` are different files.
- Allowed characters: letters, numbers, periods (`.`), underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`).
- Avoid special characters: Avoid using characters like `*`, `?`, `/`, `\`, and `&`.
- Maximum filename length: Usually 255 characters.

---

## **6. Absolute Path vs Relative Path in Linux**

- **Absolute Path**: Starts from the root `/` and provides the full path to a file or directory.
  ```bash
  /home/mohamed/documents/file.txt
  ```

- **Relative Path**: Relative to your current working directory.
  ```bash
  ./documents/file.txt    # From current directory
  ../file.txt             # One level up
  ```

---

## **7. LS Command**

The `ls` command is used to list files and directories.

### **Common `ls` Options**
- **`ls`**: List files and directories in the current directory.
- **`ls -l`**: List in long format with details like permissions, owner, size, etc.
- **`ls -a`**: List all files, including hidden files (those starting with `.`).
- **`ls -h`**: Display file sizes in human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).
- **`ls -R`**: Recursively list all files and directories.

---

## **8. Managing Files Using the Command Line**

### **Basic Commands**
- **Create file**: 
  ```bash
  touch file.txt    # Creates an empty file
  ```
- **View file**:
  ```bash
  cat file.txt      # Display file content
  ```
- **Delete file**:
  ```bash
  rm file.txt       # Remove file
  ```

---

## **9. Create & Copy Files and Directories**

### **Create Directories**
- **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
  ```bash
  mkdir my_directory
  ```

### **Copy Files and Directories**
- **`cp`**: Copy files or directories.
  ```bash
  cp file.txt /path/to/destination   # Copy a file
  cp -r dir1 /path/to/destination    # Copy a directory recursively
  ```

---

## **10. Move & Remove Files and Directories**

### **Move Files**
- **`mv`**: Move or rename files and directories.
  ```bash
  mv file.txt /new/location          # Move file to new location
  mv oldname.txt newname.txt         # Rename a file
  ```

### **Remove Files and Directories**
- **`rm`**: Remove files or directories.
  ```bash
  rm file.txt                        # Remove a file
  rm -r directory                    # Remove a directory recursively
  ```

---

## **11. Hard Links vs Soft Links**

### **Hard Links**
- A hard link points directly to the file’s data blocks. Both the original file and hard link share the same inode.
- Adds a new directory entry pointing to the same inode as the original file.  
- Both names share the same inode (verified by ls –i).  
- Changes to file content affect all hard links.  
- Limited to the same filesystem.
### **Soft (Symbolic) Links**
- A soft link is like a shortcut to the file, referencing its location. It has its own inode and points to the original file path.
- Is a separate file with its own inode that contains the pathname of the target.  
- Has a different inode from the target file.  
- If the target is moved or deleted, the symlink may break.  
- Can link across different filesystems.
---

## **12. Linux Inodes**

An inode is a data structure that stores information about a file, like its size, owner, permissions, and location on the disk, but **not the filename**. A file's name and the inode number are linked through directory entries.

---

## **13. Creating Hard Links and Soft Links (Part 1)**

### **Hard Links**
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  ln source_file hard_link_name
  ```

### **Soft Links (Symbolic Links)**
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  ln -s source_file soft_link_name
  ```

---

## **14. Creating Hard Links and Soft Links (Part 2)**

### **Creating and Viewing Links**
- **Creating Hard Link**:
  ```bash
  ln file.txt hardlink.txt
  ```
- **Creating Soft Link**:
  ```bash
  ln -s file.txt softlink.txt
  ```

- **List Links**:
  ```bash
  ls -l     # Shows links with 'l' symbol for symbolic links
  ```

---

## **15. Pattern Matching**

Pattern matching allows you to manipulate multiple files based on patterns.

### **Common Patterns**
- **`*`**: Matches any number of characters.
  ```bash
  ls *.txt      # List all .txt files
  ```
- **`?`**: Matches a single character.
  ```bash
  ls file?.txt  # Matches file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.
  ```

---

## **16. Grep Command**

The `grep` command is used to search for patterns in files.

### **Basic Usage**
```bash
grep "pattern" file.txt    # Search for 'pattern' in file.txt
grep -i "pattern" file.txt # Case-insensitive search
```

---

## **17. Using Regular Expressions with Grep**

Regular expressions (regex) allow advanced pattern matching in `grep`.

### **Common Regular Expressions**
- **`.`**: Matches any single character.
- **`^`**: Matches the start of a line.
- **`$`**: Matches the end of a line.
- **`[abc]`**: Matches any one of the characters inside the brackets.
- **`\d`**: Matches any digit.

```bash
grep "^Hello" file.txt   # Matches lines starting with 'Hello'
```

---

## **18. Cut and Tr Commands**

### **`cut` Command**
- Used to extract specific fields or columns from a file.
  ```bash
  cut -d ',' -f 1 file.csv    # Extract the first field in a comma-separated file
  ```

### **`tr` Command**
- Translates or deletes characters.
  ```bash
  echo "Hello" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'   # Converts lowercase to uppercase
  ```

---

## **19. Summary**

- **File Management**: Create, copy, move, and remove files using commands like `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm`.
- **Links**: Understand the difference between hard and soft links and how to create them.

5. **File formats and conventions** (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
6. **Games**
7. **Miscellaneous**
8. **System administration commands** (e.g., `mount`, `ifconfig`)

To view a specific section:
```bash
man 5 passwd   # View section 5 of the passwd man page
```

---

## **3. Search for Patterns in Manual Pages**

You can search for specific terms within a man page to quickly find relevant information.

### **Search Within a Man Page**
1. **Open a man page**:
   ```bash
   man <command>
   ```
2. **Search for a pattern** by typing `/` followed by the search term:
   ```bash
   /pattern
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   /option   # Search for the word "option" in the man page
   ```
3. **Navigate through results**:
   - Press `n` to move to the next match.
   - Press `N` to move to the previous match.

Most commands in Linux support the `--help` option, which provides a brief overview of the command’s usage and available options.
```bash
ls --help    # Get help for the ls command
```

### **`info` Command**
The `info` command provides more detailed documentation than man pages. It organizes content into sections and allows for better navigation between sections.
```bash
info ls    # Get information about the ls command
```

### **`apropos` Command**
The `apropos` command searches for commands related to a specific keyword. It's useful when you don’t know the exact name of the command.
```bash
apropos copy    # Search for all commands related to "copy"
```

### **`whatis` Command**
The `whatis` command provides a short description of a command.
```bash
whatis ls    # Get a brief description of the ls command
```

### **`help` Built-in Command (for Shell)**

# **Creating, Viewing, and Editing Test Files in Linux**

## **1. Introduction to Files in Linux**

In Linux, files are the building blocks for data storage, configuration, and execution. Working with files is crucial for system administrators and developers. You can create, view, and edit files using a variety of tools like `touch`, `cat`, `echo`, and text editors like **Vim**.

### **Common File Commands**
- **Creating a file**:
  ```bash
  touch testfile.txt   # Creates an empty file
  echo "Hello World" > testfile.txt   # Creates a file with content
  ```
- **Viewing a file**:
  ```bash
  cat testfile.txt     # Displays content of the file
  less testfile.txt    # View file content in a paginated form
  ```
- **Editing a file**: 
  - Text editors like **Vim** or **Nano** can be used to modify files.
  ```bash
  vim testfile.txt
  nano testfile.txt
  ```

---

## **2 Input/Output Redirection**

Linux allows you to redirect the standard input (stdin), output (stdout), and error (stderr) of commands to files or other commands. This is helpful for managing outputs and saving logs.

### **Input Redirection (`<`)**
- Redirects input from a file to a command:
  ```bash
  command < inputfile
  ```

### **Output Redirection (`>`, `>>`)**
- **`>`**: Overwrites the content of a file with the output of a command.
  ```bash
  echo "New content" > outputfile.txt   # Overwrites file content
  ```
- **`>>`**: Appends the output of a command to a file without overwriting.
  ```bash
  echo "More content" >> outputfile.txt   # Appends to file
  ```

### **Error Redirection (`2>`, `2>>`)**
- Redirects standard error to a file.
  ```bash
  command 2> errorfile.txt     # Redirects errors to a file
  command 2>> errorfile.txt    # Appends errors to a file
  ```
**Combined Output and Error Redirection**
Linux provides several methods to combine output (stdout) and error (stderr) redirection in a single command. This is useful for comprehensive logging and error handling.

**Separate Files Redirection**
* Redirects standard output and error to different files:

```bash
command > output.txt 2> error.txt
```

**Combined Output and Error** (`&>`, `2>&1`)
* Redirects both output and error to the same file:

```bash
# Method 1 (traditional syntax)
command > combined.txt 2>&1

# Method 2 (modern syntax)
command &> combined.txt
```

**Append Combined Output and Error** (`&>>`, `2>&1`)
* Appends both output and error to an existing file:

```bash
# Method 1 (traditional syntax)
command >> combined.txt 2>&1

# Method 2 (modern syntax)
command &>> combined.txt
```

**Common Use Cases**
* Logging script execution:

```bash
./script.sh > output.log 2> error.log    # Separate logs
./script.sh &> complete.log              # Combined log
```

* Running background processes:

```bash
nohup ./long_process.sh &> process.log &
```
---

### **3. Piping in Linux**
Piping allows the output of one command to be used as input to another command. It helps create complex commands by chaining simpler ones.

**Pipe** (`|`)
* Combines commands by passing output from one command as input to another
* Multiple pipes can be chained together for complex operations

**Common Piping Examples:**
```bash
# Find specific files and count them
ls -l | grep "*.txt" | wc -l    # Count how many .txt files exist

# Process text and sort results
cat log.txt | grep "ERROR" | sort -u    # Find unique error messages

# Monitor system processes
ps aux | grep "firefox" | grep -v "grep"    # Find Firefox processes

# Complex text processing
cat access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c    # Count unique IP addresses

# System monitoring
df -h | grep "/dev/sd" | sort -k 5    # List disk usage, sorted by usage percentage
```

## **4. VIM Editor Command Operating Modes**
**Vim** is a powerful text editor with multiple operating modes for efficient text manipulation.

**Command Mode (Normal Mode)**
* Default mode when opening Vim
* Navigation and command execution mode
* Common commands:
```bash
h    # Move left

## **6. Shell Variables (Part 1, 2, 3)**

Shell variables are fundamental for storing and managing data in shell scripts. Understanding different types of variables and their usage is crucial for effective shell programming.

### **Part 1: User-Defined Variables**
- Variables created by users for temporary data storage
- Naming rules:
  - Must start with a letter or underscore
  - Can contain letters, numbers, underscores
  - Case-sensitive
```bash
# Basic variable assignment
NAME="John"
AGE=25
CURRENT_DATE=$(date)

# Using variables
echo "Hello, $NAME!"
echo "You are ${AGE} years old"
echo "Today is: $CURRENT_DATE"

# Arithmetic with variables
COUNT=5
TOTAL=$((COUNT + 3))
echo $TOTAL        # Outputs: 8

# String concatenation
FIRST="Hello"
SECOND="World"
GREETING="$FIRST $SECOND"
echo $GREETING     # Outputs: Hello World
```

### **Part 2: Environment Variables**
- System-wide variables affecting program behavior
- Common environment variables:
```bash
# Display common environment variables
echo "Home Directory: $HOME"
echo "Current User: $USER"
echo "Shell Type: $SHELL"
echo "System Path: $PATH"

# Modifying PATH temporarily
PATH=$PATH:/new/path
echo $PATH

# Setting custom environment variables
export CUSTOM_VAR="my value"
echo $CUSTOM_VAR

# Checking environment variables
env | grep CUSTOM_VAR
```

### **Part 3: Positional Parameters**
- Special variables for script arguments
- Common positional parameters:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as script.sh and run: ./script.sh arg1 arg2 arg3

echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "All arguments: $@"
echo "Number of arguments: $#"

# Loop through all arguments
for arg in "$@"
do
    echo "Argument: $arg"
done

# Using shift to process arguments
while [ "$1" != "" ]; do
    echo "Processing: $1"
    shift
done
```

## **7. Managing Shell Variables**

### **Temporary Variables**
```bash
# Creating temporary variables
TEMP_VAR="This is temporary"
echo $TEMP_VAR

# These variables are lost when terminal closes
```

### **Permanent Variables**
```bash
# Adding to .bashrc
echo 'export PERMANENT_VAR="This is permanent"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Adding to specific application configs
echo 'export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Applying changes
source ~/.bashrc
```

### **Variable Operations**
```bash
# Check if variable exists
if [ -z "$VARIABLE" ]; then
    echo "Variable is empty or not set"
fi

# Set default value if variable is empty
MYVAR=${MYVAR:-"default value"}

# Make variable readonly
readonly CONST_VAR="cannot change this"

# Unset variables
unset TEMP_VAR

# Variable substitution
echo ${STRING:-"Default"} # Use default if STRING is unset
echo ${STRING:="Default"} # Set default if STRING is unset
```

### **Practical Examples**

**1. Backup Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/backups"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_FILE="backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"

# Create backup
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE" "$HOME/documents"
```

**2. Configuration Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Default values
DB_HOST=${DB_HOST:-"localhost"}
DB_PORT=${DB_PORT:-3306}
DB_USER=${DB_USER:-"root"}

echo "Database Configuration:"
echo "Host: $DB_HOST"
echo "Port: $DB_PORT"
echo "User: $DB_USER"
```

**3. Path Management**
```bash
# Add multiple directories to PATH
add_to_path() {
    for dir in "$@"; do
        if [ -d "$dir" ] && [[ ":$PATH:" != *":$dir:"* ]]; then
            PATH="$dir:$PATH"
        fi
    done
}

add_to_path "/usr/local/bin" "$HOME/bin"
```

# Comprehensive Guide to Linux User & Group Management

## 1. User Fundamentals

### User Categories
| User Type       | UID Range       | Purpose                          |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| Superuser (root)| 0               | Full system administration      |
| System Users    | 1-999           | Service accounts & daemons       |
| Regular Users   | 1000+           | Human users & applications       |

*Note: UID ranges may vary slightly between distributions (RHEL: 1-499, 500-999 | Debian: 1-999)*

### Key Identification Commands
```bash
whoami        # Show current effective user
id            # Display user & group info
lastlog       # Show recent user logins
```

---

## 2. User Switching & Environment

### `su` vs `su -`
```bash
su user01      # Switches user, keeps current environment
su - user01    # Switches user AND:
               # - Loads user's environment variables
               # - Changes to home directory
               # - Executes user's shell profile
```

### Environment Verification
```bash
echo $PATH     # Compare paths between both su methods
pwd            # Show current working directory
```

---

## 3. Privilege Escalation with Sudo

### Key Concepts
- Configured via `/etc/sudoers` (always edit with `visudo`)
- Log locations:
  - RHEL/CentOS: `/var/log/secure`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `/var/log/auth.log`

### Common Sudo Entries
```bash
# User Privileges
user01  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL                # Full sudo access
user02  ALL=(root) /usr/bin/apt,/usr/bin/dnf  # Specific commands

# Group Privileges
%admins ALL=(ALL) ALL                    # Group-based access
%devs   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/git # Passwordless execution
```

### Sudo Command Options
```bash
sudo -l              # List allowed commands
sudo -u user01 whoami  # Run as specific user
```

---

## 4. User Account Management

### Creating Users
```bash
useradd -m -d /home/mohamed -s /bin/bash -c "Developer" -G developers,sudo -u 1501 mohamed
```
- **Options Breakdown**:
  - `-m`: Create home directory
  - `-d`: Specify custom home path
  - `-s`: Set default shell (common: `/bin/bash`, `/sbin/nologin`)
  - `-G`: Add to secondary groups (comma-separated)
  - `-u`: Specify custom UID

### Modifying Users
```bash
usermod -aG docker mohamed        # Add to docker group (preserves existing)
usermod -L mohamed                # Lock account (password login disabled)
usermod -e 2024-12-31 mohamed     # Set account expiration
usermod -s /sbin/nologin mohamed  # Disable shell access
```

### Deleting Users
```bash
userdel mohamed        # Remove account (keep files)
userdel -r mohamed     # Remove account AND:
                   # - Home directory
                   # - Mail spool
                   # - User cron jobs
```

### Password Management
```bash
passwd mohamed         # Set/change password
chage -l mohamed       # View password aging info
chage -M 90 mohamed    # Set maximum password days
```

---

## 5. Group Administration

### Creating & Managing Groups
```bash
groupadd -g 2001 developers       # Create with custom GID
groupmod -n devs developers       # Rename group
gpasswd -a john devs              # Add user to group
gpasswd -d john devs              # Remove user from group
groupdel devs                     # Delete empty group

```

### Important Files
```bash
/etc/passwd     # User account information
/etc/shadow     # Secure user password storage
/etc/group      # Group definitions
/etc/sudoers    # Sudo privileges configuration
```

---

## 6. Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Grant minimal necessary sudo access
   - Use groups for permission management

2. **Account Security**
   ```bash
   usermod -L service_account      # Lock unused accounts
   chage -E 0 temp_user            # Immediately expire account
   ```

3. **Shell Restrictions**
   ```bash
   usermod -s /sbin/nologin db_user  # Prevent interactive login
   ```

4. **Audit & Monitoring**
   ```bash
   sudo grep 'FAILED LOGIN' /var/log/auth.log  # Review auth attempts
   lastlog                                   # Check last login times
   ```

5. **Sudo Configuration**
   - Prefer group-based permissions
   - Use command paths (not aliases)
   - Implement timeout with `Defaults timestamp_timeout=15`

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Guide

**Common Issues**:
- **Permission Denied**:
  ```bash
  groups $(whoami)  # Verify group memberships
  sudo -l           # Check sudo privileges
  ```
  
- **Account Locked**:
  ```bash
  passwd -S user01  # Check account status
  pam_tally2 --user=user01  # View failed attempts
  ```

- **Missing Home Directory**:
  ```bash
  sudo mkhomedir_helper username  # Create home dir
  ```

---

## 8. Advanced Configuration

### Custom Sudoers Entries
```bash
# Allow passwordless package management
%developers ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt, /usr/bin/dnf

# Allow service management without full sudo
User_Alias SUPPORT = alice,bob
SUPPORT ALL= /usr/bin/systemctl restart *, /usr/bin/systemctl status *
```

### UID/GID Mapping Verification
```bash
getent passwd user01  # Verify user information
getent group developers  # Check group details
```

## Managing User Passwords

In Linux, user passwords are securely stored and managed to help protect your system. Password information is kept in the `/etc/shadow` file, which contains critical data about each user account.

### Password Storage in `/etc/shadow`

An example entry in `/etc/shadow` looks like this:

```bash
user03:$6$CSsX...:17933:0:9999:7::18113:
```

The fields in the file (separated by colons) include:

1. **Username**: The account name.
2. **Encrypted Password**: The hashed password (using secure algorithms such as SHA-512).
3. **Last Password Change**: Number of days since January 1, 1970.
4. **Minimum Days**: Minimum days between password changes.
5. **Maximum Days**: Maximum days before the password expires.
6. **Warning Period**: Days before expiration that the user is warned.
7. **Inactive Period**: Days of inactivity before the account is locked.
8. **Expiration Date**: Days since January 1, 1970 after which the account expires.
9. **Reserved**: Reserved for future use.

*Note:* Because `/etc/shadow` is readable only by root, even if someone gains unprivileged access to your system, they cannot easily obtain your password hashes.

### Configuring Password Aging with `chage`

You can configure password aging policies using the `chage` command. For example, to set a policy for user `user03`:

```bash
chage -m 0 -M 90 -W 7 -I 14 user03
```

Where:

- `-m 0`: The minimum number of days before a password can be changed.
- `-M 90`: The maximum number of days the password is valid.
- `-W 7`: The number of days before expiration that a warning is issued.
- `-I 14`: The number of inactive days before the account is locked.

This policy ensures passwords are changed regularly and users receive timely notifications before expiration.

## Controlling Access to Files

Linux file access is managed through a robust permissions system that controls who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.

### Understanding File Types and Permissions

Each file in Linux is assigned a type and a set of permissions. Common file types include:

- **d**: Directory
- **-**: Regular file
- **c**: Character device file
- **b**: Block device file
- **l**: Symbolic link
- **p**: Named pipe (FIFO)

A sample output from `ls -l` might look like:

```bash
-rwxr-x--- 1 root root 0 Oct 31 11:06 test
```

In this listing:

- The first character (`-`) indicates it is a regular file.
- The next nine characters are split into three groups:
  - **User (owner):** `rwx` – read, write, execute.
  - **Group:** `r-x` – read and execute.
  - **Others:** `---` – no permissions.

### Changing Permissions: Symbolic and Numeric Methods

#### Symbolic Method

You can modify permissions with symbolic operators:

- **+** to add,
- **-** to remove,
- **=** to set exactly.

Examples:

```bash
chmod u+r test      # Add read permission for the owner
chmod g-w test      # Remove write permission for the group
chmod a+x test      # Add execute permission for all users
chmod u+rwx,g=rx,o-w test  # Combination: full for owner, read and execute for group, remove write for others
```

#### Numeric (Octal) Method

Each permission is represented by a number:

- **7**: Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1)
- **6**: Read (4) + Write (2)
- **5**: Read (4) + Execute (1)
- **4**: Read only

Example:

```bash
chmod 777 test   # Full permissions for everyone (rwx for user, group, and others)
```

### Changing Ownership and Group Association

Ownership can be modified with the `chown` and `chgrp` commands.

- Change file owner:
  ```bash
  chown mohamed file1
  ```
- Change owner and group:
  ```bash
  chown mohamed:mohamed file1
  ```
- Change only the group:
  ```bash
  chown :mohamed file1
  chgrp mohamed file1
  ```
- Recursively change ownership for a directory:
  ```bash
  chown -R root:root dir1
  ```

### Special Permissions: setuid, setgid, and Sticky Bit

Special permissions grant additional controls:

- **setuid (u+s):** When set on an executable, the program runs with the file owner’s privileges.
  ```bash
  chmod u+s file   # Symbolic method
  chmod 4755 file  # Numeric method (adds setuid)
  ```
- **setgid (g+s):** Ensures new files in a directory inherit the directory’s group.
  ```bash
  chmod g+s dir1   # Symbolic method
  chmod 2770 dir1  # Numeric method (for directories)
  ```
- **Sticky Bit (o+t):** Prevents users from deleting files in a directory unless they are the file owner.
  ```bash
  chmod o+t dir1   # Symbolic method
  ```

### Searching for Files and Using umask

- **Finding File Locations:**

  - `which <file>`: Locates a file in the system path.
  - `locate <file>`: Searches a file database.
  - `updatedb`: Updates the locate database.

- **Default File Permissions (umask):**

The `umask` command sets the default permissions for new files and directories. For example:

```bash
umask       # Displays the current mask (usually 0022 for root or 0002 for regular users)
umask 007   # Sets a stricter mask (files: 660, directories: 770)
```

Calculation example for umask `0022`:

- Default permissions for directories: `777 - 022 = 755` (rwxr-xr-x)
- For files: `666 - 022 = 644` (rw-r--r--)

To make the umask permanent for a user, add it to the user's shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`):

```bash
echo "umask 007" >> ~/.bashrc
```

---

## Monitoring and Managing Linux Processes

A process in Linux is an instance of a running executable. Each process has a unique Process ID (PID) and a Parent Process ID (PPID). Here are some essential commands for process management.

### Process Identification and Listing Commands

- **Identify the Current User:**

  ```bash
  whoami
  ```

- **List Running Processes:**

  ```bash
  ps         # Basic process list
  ps aux     # Detailed list including processes without a controlling terminal
  ps lax     # Extended listing with more technical details
  ```

- **Interactive Process Viewer:**

  ```bash
  top        # Similar to Windows Task Manager
  ```

### Tree Views and User-Specific Process Filtering

- **Process Tree:**

  ```bash
  pstree      # Show processes in a tree structure
  pstree -p   # Include PIDs in the tree view
  ```

- **Display Processes of a Specific User:**

  ```bash
  pstree -p mohamed
  pgrep -u mohamed -l   # List process names with PIDs for user "mohamed"
  ```

---

## Conclusion

By mastering the management of user passwords, controlling file access, and monitoring processes, you can significantly improve the security and efficiency of your Linux environment. Using tools like `chage`, `chmod`, `chown`, and process listing commands (`ps`, `top`, `pstree`), system administrators can enforce security policies and ensure that only authorized users have appropriate access.

Remember:

- **Secure your passwords** by understanding how they are stored and when to change them.
- **Manage file permissions** diligently using symbolic and numeric modes.
- **Monitor processes** effectively to catch suspicious activity early.

For further details on these topics, consult the system manuals (`man` pages) and trusted online Linux documentation.

## Advanced Process and Job Control

Managing processes in Linux isn’t limited to just running commands and monitoring their resource usage—it also involves controlling their execution state, handling background jobs, and adjusting priorities. The following subsections expand on these tasks and provide practical improvements for effective process management.

### Managing Background and Foreground Processes

**Running Processes in the Background**

- **Starting a Background Process:**\
  To run a command in the background, append an ampersand (`&`) to the command.

  ```bash
  <command> &
  ```

  *Example:*

  ```bash
  sleep 600 &
  ```

  This starts the `sleep` command (simulating a long-running process) and immediately returns control to the terminal.

- **Listing Background Jobs:**\
  Use the `jobs` command to see all background tasks in your current shell session.

  ```bash
  jobs
  ```

  The output displays each job’s number (e.g., `[1]`), its status (Running, Stopped), and the command that initiated it.

**Bringing a Background Process to the Foreground**

- **Using **``**:**\
  To resume a background job in the foreground (so you can interact with it or view its output), use the `fg` command followed by the job number (prefixed with `%`):
  ```bash
  fg %<job number>
  ```
  *Example:*
  ```bash
  fg %1
  ```
  This brings job number 1 into the foreground. Once foregrounded, the process will again tie to your terminal, and you can use keyboard interrupts (e.g., Ctrl+C) if needed.

**Best Practices and Improvements**

- **Signal Awareness:**\
  Remember that background jobs are associated with the current terminal session. If you open a new terminal or disconnect from your session, the jobs managed by that shell won’t appear in the new session’s job list. For long-running tasks that need to persist beyond your session, consider using `nohup`, `screen`, or `tmux`.

- **Job Control Commands:**\
  Beyond `fg` and `jobs`, you can use `bg` to resume a stopped job in the background. For example, if you accidentally pause a process with Ctrl+Z, use:

  ```bash
  bg %<job number>
  ```

  This resumes the process in the background while keeping it in the jobs list.

### Killing and Stopping Processes

Effective process termination is critical for system stability. Linux provides several commands to send signals that control process behavior.

**Killing a Process**

- **By PID:**\
  Use the `kill` command with a process ID (PID) to send a termination signal. The default signal is SIGTERM (15), which requests a graceful shutdown.

  ```bash
  kill <PID>
  ```

  To force an immediate termination, use SIGKILL (9):

  ```bash
  kill -9 <PID>
  ```

- **Listing Kill Signals:**\
  To see all available signals:

  ```bash
  kill -l
  ```

- **Special Cases:**\
  Sometimes you might use SIGHUP (1) to instruct a process to reload its configuration without fully terminating it:

  ```bash
  kill -1 <PID>
  ```

**Finding and Killing Processes by Name or User**

  Retrieve the PID of a process by name:

  ```bash
  pidof <process_name>
  ```


  - To kill all instances of a process:
    ```bash
    killall <process_name>
    ```
  - To kill all processes owned by a specific user:
    ```bash
    pkill -U <username>
    ```

**Best Practices and Improvements**

- **Graceful Termination:**\
  When possible, first try SIGTERM to allow processes to clean up. If a process does not exit within a reasonable time, follow up with SIGKILL.
- **Avoiding Self-Termination:**\
  Be cautious when killing process groups; if your command targets processes within the same group as your shell, you may inadvertently send signals to your own session. Use process group IDs (PGIDs) wisely (e.g., `kill -- -$PGID`).

### Monitoring and Scheduling Processes

Linux provides a suite of tools to monitor processes in real time and adjust their priorities to optimize performance.

**Monitoring Processes**


  - `top` gives a real-time view of running processes, displaying key metrics such as CPU, memory usage, and process state. Use options like `-n` to limit updates or `-d` to set the delay between updates:
    ```bash
    top -n 2
    top -d 2
    ```
  - `htop` is an enhanced, interactive alternative to top. It allows you to scroll, search, and even kill processes using function keys (e.g., F9).

- **Other Monitoring Tools:**\
  Tools like `iotop` (for disk I/O), `vmstat` (for overall system performance), and `free -h` (for memory usage) provide further insights into resource utilization.

**Process Scheduling and Priorities**

- **Listing Priorities:**\
  Use `ps` to list processes along with their nice values:
  ```bash
  ps axo user,pid,nice,command
  ```
  - **Starting a Process with a Custom Priority:**
    ```bash
    nice -n 10 <command> &
    ```
    This starts the process with a nice value of 10 (lower priority than the default 0).
  - **Changing Priority of a Running Process:**
    ```bash
    renice <nice_value> -p <PID>
    ```
    For example, to lower the priority of all sleep processes:
    ```bash
    renice 19 $(pgrep sleep)
    ```

**Best Practices and Improvements**

- **Prioritize Critical Tasks:**\
  Use lower nice values (e.g., -5 to -20) for processes that must complete quickly and higher values (e.g., 10 to 19) for background tasks.
- **Automation:**\
  Consider setting up cron jobs or monitoring scripts that adjust priorities dynamically based on system load. This ensures critical applications maintain responsiveness while background jobs are throttled.

## Final Summary

By mastering advanced process and job control, you enhance your ability to multitask, maintain system performance, and troubleshoot issues effectively on Linux. Here’s a quick recap:

- **Background/Foreground Management:**
  - Run commands in the background using `&`, monitor with `jobs`, and manage with `fg`/`bg`.
- **Killing and Stopping Processes:**
  - Use `kill`, `killall`, and `pkill` with appropriate signals (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, SIGHUP) to terminate processes.
- **Monitoring and Scheduling:**
  - Tools like `top`, `htop`, and `ps` help you monitor active processes and resource usage.
  - Adjust process priorities using `nice` and `renice` to optimize performance.

These techniques empower you to manage and schedule processes effectively, ensuring that your Linux system remains secure, responsive, and efficient.


--# **Controlling Services and Daemons in Linux**

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, **systemd** is the first process that starts (PID 1), managing all other system services and processes.

### **Common `systemctl` Commands**

1. **Listing Services**:
   - To list all active services:
     ```bash
     systemctl list-units --type=service
     ```
   - To list all active and inactive services:
     ```bash
     systemctl list-units --type=service --all
     ```
   - To list failed services:
     ```bash
     systemctl --failed --type=service
     ```

2. **Viewing Service Status**:
   - To check the status of a specific service (e.g., `sshd`):
     ```bash
     systemctl status sshd.service
     ```

3. **Service State Queries**:
   - Check if a service is active:
     ```bash
     systemctl is-active sshd.service
     ```
   - Check if a service is enabled to start at boot:
     ```bash
     systemctl is-enabled sshd.service
     ```
   - Check if a service has failed:
     ```bash
     systemctl is-failed sshd.service
     ```

### **Managing Services**

1. **Starting and Stopping Services**:
   - Start a service:
     ```bash
     systemctl start sshd.service
     ```
   - Stop a service:
     ```bash
     systemctl stop sshd.service
     ```
   - Restart a service:
     ```bash
     systemctl restart sshd.service
     ```

2. **Reloading a Service**:
   - Reload a service to re-read its configuration file without stopping it:
     ```bash
     systemctl reload sshd.service
     ```

3. **Managing Service Startup at Boot**:
   - Enable a service to start at boot:
     ```bash
     systemctl enable sshd.service
     ```
   - Disable a service from starting automatically at boot:
     ```bash
     systemctl disable sshd.service
     ```

### **Masking and Unmasking Services**

- **Masking** a service prevents it from being started (either manually or automatically):
   ```bash
   systemctl mask sendmail.service
   ```

- **Unmasking** a service re-enables it:
   ```bash
   systemctl unmask sendmail.service
   ```

### **Additional Commands**

1. **Listing Service Dependencies**:
   - To display a hierarchy of service dependencies:
     ```bash
     systemctl list-dependencies <unit>
     ```
   
By mastering these `systemctl` commands, you can control, monitor, and manage services and daemons effectively on a Linux system.

# **Configuration and Securing SSH**

### **Basic SSH Usage**

1. **SSH for Remote Interactive Shell**:
   - The command below opens a remote interactive shell on a remote system.
   
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@<remotehost>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   ssh student@serverb
   ```

2. **SSH Command Execution without Interactive Shell**:
   - You can use SSH to execute a command on the remote system without accessing the interactive shell.
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   ssh <student>@<serverb> hostname
   ```
   This command runs the `hostname` command on the remote system as the `student` user.

3. **Execute Multiple Commands Remotely**:
   - Execute a series of commands without an interactive shell:
   
   ```bash
   ssh <username>@<remotehost> 'date; ls -lh'
   ```

---

### **Types of SSH Authentication**

There are two main types of authentication in SSH:

1. **Password Authentication**:
   - Requires the user to enter their password to access the remote system.

2. **Key-Based Authentication**:
   - A more secure method involving a key pair: a **private key** and a **public key**.

---

### **Generating SSH Key Pair**


#### Basic Command
```bash
ssh-keygen
```
This command generates a pair of cryptographic keys (private and public) and saves them in your `~/.ssh/` directory:
- **Private key**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (keep this secure and never share it)
- **Public key**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (can be shared freely)

#### Recommended Modern Method (Ed25519)
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- `-t ed25519`: Specifies the Ed25519 algorithm (more secure and faster than RSA)
- `-C`: Adds a comment (typically your email) to help identify the key

#### Legacy Systems (RSA Fallback)
For older systems that don't support Ed25519:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- `-t rsa`: Uses the RSA algorithm
- `-b 4096`: Creates a 4096-bit key (more secure than default 2048-bit)

#### Key Files
- Default private key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- Default public key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- Ed25519 private key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- Ed25519 public key: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

#### File Permissions
**Critical Security Note**: Proper file permissions are essential for SSH key security.

- The private key must have strict permissions set to `600` (read/write for owner only):
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ```

- The public key should have permissions set to `644` (readable by others):
  ```bash
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
  ```

- The `.ssh` directory itself should have permissions set to `700`:
  ```bash
  chmod 700 ~/.ssh
  ```

---

### **Copying Public Key to Remote Server**

1. **Using `ssh-copy-id`**:
   - Automatically copies your public key to the remote system:

     ```bash
     ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mohamed@192.168.1.10
     ```

2. **Manually Copying the Public Key**:
   - If `ssh-copy-id` is not available, you can manually copy the key:

   1. **Copy the public key**:
      ```bash
      clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      ```
   
   2. **Access the remote server** and navigate to the `.ssh` directory:
      ```bash
      cd /root/.ssh
      ```

   3. **Add the public key** to the `authorized_keys` file:
      ```bash
      vi authorized_keys
      ```

   4. **Paste** the copied public key and save the file.

---

### **Customizing SSH Service Configuration**

The OpenSSH service is controlled by a daemon called **sshd**, and its main configuration file is located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

1. **Disabling Root Login**:
   - To enhance security, disable root login via SSH by modifying the `PermitRootLogin` setting in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
   
   ```bash
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```

2. **Disabling Password Authentication**:
   - To force users to authenticate using SSH keys and disable password authentication, modify the `PasswordAuthentication` setting:
   
   ```bash
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```

3. **Reloading the SSH Service**:
   - After making changes to the configuration file, reload the SSH service to apply the changes:
   
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload sshd.service
   ```

### **Note:**
- By default, SSH listens on **port 22**. You can change this by modifying the `Port` setting in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

# System Logging in Red Hat Enterprise Linux

This guide enhances the understanding of system logging in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) by providing detailed explanations, practical examples, and additional insights into the logging architecture, log management with `logrotate`, log viewing with `journalctl`, and time zone configuration. It builds on the foundational concepts of RHEL logging to offer a more actionable and in-depth resource for system administrators.

## 1. System Logging Architecture in RHEL

RHEL’s logging system captures system events, errors, and activities to aid in troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and security auditing. It relies on two primary components: `systemd-journald` and `rsyslog`, which work together to provide both modern and traditional logging capabilities.

### Components of the Logging Architecture

- **systemd-journald**:
  - **Role**: Collects logs from the Linux kernel, system services, and applications in a structured, binary format. This format includes metadata like timestamps, process IDs (`_PID`), and systemd unit names (`_SYSTEMD_UNIT`).
  - **Storage**: By default, logs are stored in `/run/log/journal/`, a volatile location cleared on reboot. Persistent storage in `/var/log/journal/` can be enabled (We will talk about it right).
  - **Interaction**: Forwards logs to `rsyslog` for text-based logging and supports direct querying via `journalctl`.
  - **Example**: A kernel panic message is captured by journald and can be viewed with `journalctl -k`.

- **rsyslog**:
  - **Role**: Processes logs from journald and routes them to text files in `/var/log` based on **facility** (e.g., `auth`, `cron`) and **priority** (e.g., `error`, `info`). It also supports remote logging and advanced filtering.
  - **Configuration**: Defined in `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and `/etc/rsyslog.d/`. For instance:
    ```
    auth.*    /var/log/secure
    ```
    directs all authentication logs to `/var/log/secure`.
  - **Protocols**: Supports TCP, UDP, and RELP for remote logging, with optional TLS encryption for secure transmission.
  - **Example**: An SSH login attempt is logged to `/var/log/secure` via rsyslog.

- **Interaction Between journald and rsyslog**:
  - journald collects logs in binary format and forwards them to rsyslog.
  - rsyslog filters and writes logs to text files (e.g., `/var/log/messages`) or sends them to remote servers.
  - This dual approach allows structured querying with `journalctl` and compatibility with legacy tools via rsyslog.

### Common Log Files

| **Log File**         | **Description**                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/var/log/messages`  | General system messages (excludes some security/debug logs).  |
| `/var/log/secure`    | Security and authentication events (e.g., SSH logins).        |
| `/var/log/maillog`   | Mail server activities.                                      |
| `/var/log/cron`      | Cron job execution logs.                                     |
| `/var/log/boot.log`  | System boot process messages.                                |

### Practical Example
To view recent authentication events:
```bash
cat /var/log/secure
```
Or, using journald:
```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service
```

## 2. Configuring Persistent Logging with journald

By default, `systemd-journald` stores logs in `/run/log/journal/`, which is cleared on reboot. For auditing, compliance, or long-term troubleshooting, configure persistent logging to store logs in `/var/log/journal/`.

### Steps to Enable Persistent Logging

1. **Create the Journal Directory**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /var/log/journal
   ```
   This directory will store persistent logs.

2. **Update journald Configuration**:
   - Edit `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/systemd/journald.conf
     ```
   - Set `Storage=persistent`:
     ```
     [Journal]
     Storage=persistent
     ```
   - Save and exit.

3. **Restart journald**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
   ```

4. **Verify Persistence**:
   - Reboot the system:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```
   - Check for log files:
     ```bash
     ls /var/log/journal
     ```
     Expected output: directories like `75ab164a278e48be9cf80d80716a8cd9`.

### Why Persistent Logging Matters
Persistent logs ensure historical data is available for analyzing security incidents (e.g., unauthorized access attempts) or system crashes, which is critical for compliance and forensics.

## 3. Managing Log Files with logrotate

`logrotate` is a utility that manages log file growth by rotating, compressing, and deleting logs based on user-defined rules. This prevents `/var/log` from consuming excessive disk space.

### Key Features of logrotate

- **Rotation**: Renames log files (e.g., `messages` to `messages.1`) and creates a new empty log file.
- **Compression**: Compresses rotated logs (e.g., `messages.1.gz`) to save space.
- **Retention**: Deletes logs older than a specified period.

### Configuration Files

- **Main Configuration**: `/etc/logrotate.conf` sets global settings, such as default rotation frequency (e.g., weekly) and number of retained logs.
- **Package-Specific Configurations**: `/etc/logrotate.d/` contains rules for specific services (e.g., `/etc/logrotate.d/httpd` for Apache).

### Example logrotate Configuration
For `/var/log/secure`:
```
/var/log/secure {
    rotate 4
    weekly
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    create 0640 root root
}
```
- `rotate 4`: Keep 4 rotated logs.
- `weekly`: Rotate weekly.
- `compress`: Compress rotated logs.
- `delaycompress`: Compress after the next rotation.
- `missingok`: Ignore missing log files.
- `create 0640 root root`: Create a new log file with specified permissions.

### Scheduling logrotate
- logrotate runs daily via a cron job in `/etc/cron.daily/logrotate`.
- To trigger manually for testing:
  ```bash
  sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf
  ```

### Checking logrotate Status
- View the last rotation details:
  ```bash
  cat /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status
  ```
  Example output:
  ```
  "/var/log/secure" 2025-05-01
  ```

## 4. Viewing and Filtering Logs with journalctl

`journalctl` is the primary tool for querying journald logs, offering powerful filtering and formatting options.

### Common journalctl Commands

- **View Recent Logs**:
  ```bash
  journalctl -n 10
  ```
  Shows the last 10 entries.

- **Follow Logs in Real-Time**:
  ```bash
  journalctl -f
  ```
  Similar to `tail -f`.

- **Filter by Priority**:
  ```bash
  journalctl -p error
  ```
  Shows logs at `error` priority or higher (e.g., `error`, `critical`, `alert`).

- **Filter by Boot**:
  ```bash
  journalctl -b
  ```
  Shows logs from the current boot.

- **Filter by Time**:
  ```bash
  journalctl --since "2025-05-01" --until "2025-05-03"
  ```
  Shows logs between specified dates.

- **Filter by Service**:
  ```bash
  journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service
  ```
  Shows logs for the SSH service.

### Log Highlighting
- **Bold**: `notice` or `warning` priority logs.
- **Red**: `error`, `critical`, `alert`, or `emergency` priority logs.

### Example: Troubleshooting SSH Issues
To find failed SSH login attempts:
```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service -p error
```

## 5. Configuring Time Zone and System Time

Accurate timestamps in logs are essential for correlating events, especially in distributed systems. Use `timedatectl` to manage time settings.

### Common timedatectl Commands

- **List Available Time Zones**:
  ```bash
  timedatectl list-timezones
  ```

- **Set Time Zone**:
  ```bash
  sudo timedatectl set-timezone Africa/Cairo
  ```

- **Set System Time**:
  ```bash
  sudo timedatectl set-time "2025-05-03 14:00:00"
  ```

- **Enable NTP Synchronization**:
  ```bash
  sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
  ```

### Example
To ensure logs use the correct time zone:
```bash
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Europe/Amsterdam
journalctl --since "1 hour ago"
```

## 6. Practical Applications

- **Troubleshooting**: Use `journalctl -p error` to identify critical system errors, such as service failures.
- **Security Auditing**: Monitor `/var/log/secure` or `journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service` for unauthorized access attempts.
- **Remote Logging**: Configure rsyslog to send logs to a central server:
  ```
  *.* @192.168.1.100:514
  ```
  This enhances centralized monitoring in enterprise environments.

## 7. Sending Custom Logs with logger

The `logger` command allows manual log generation for testing or scripting:
```bash
logger -p auth.err "Test authentication error"
```
This logs a message to `/var/log/secure` with `auth.err` priority.

## Conclusion


This guide provides a detailed and practical overview of system logging in RHEL, covering the architecture (`systemd-journald` and `rsyslog`), persistent logging configuration, log rotation with `logrotate`, log viewing with `journalctl`, and time zone management with `timedatectl`. By including step-by-step instructions and examples, it equips administrators with the tools to effectively manage and troubleshoot system logs.

## Goal and Objectives

### Goal
Configure network interfaces and settings on RHEL servers to ensure reliable connectivity and optimal performance.

### Objectives
1. Configure and modify network settings from the command line interface (CLI).
2. Manage network settings and devices using `nmcli`.
3. Troubleshoot connectivity issues using CLI commands.
4. Change server hostnames and DNS configurations from the CLI.

## Note for RHEL 9 Users
In RHEL 9, the default storage for network configuration has shifted from `ifcfg` files to **keyfiles** [RHEL 9 Networking](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rhel-9-networking-say-goodbye-ifcfg-files-and-hello-keyfiles). New network profiles are stored in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` instead of `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`. While `ifcfg` files are still supported for backward compatibility, keyfiles are recommended for new configurations. This guide covers both methods, with specific instructions for RHEL 9 users.

## Gathering Network Interface Information

Understanding your network interfaces is the first step in configuration and troubleshooting.

### Commands for Network Information
- **`ip link`**: Lists all network interfaces.
  ```bash
  ip link
  ```
  **Example Output**:
  ```
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
  2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/ether 52:54:00:12:34:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  ```

- **`ip addr show`**: Displays IP addresses and interface details.
  ```bash
  ip addr show eth0
  ```
  **Example Output**:
  ```
  2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
      link/ether 52:54:00:12:34:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
      inet 192.168.1.100/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global eth0
         valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
  ```

- **`ping`**: Tests connectivity to a host.
  ```bash
  ping -c 4 google.com
  ```
  **Example Output**:
  ```
  PING google.com (142.250.190.78) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 142.250.190.78: icmp_seq=1 ttl=117 time=23.4 ms
  ...
  ```

- **`nmcli` for Network Overview**:
  - Show device status:
    ```bash
    nmcli device status
    ```
    **Example Output**:
    ```
    DEVICE  TYPE      STATE      CONNECTION
    eth0    ethernet  connected  static-eth0
    lo      loopback  unmanaged  --
    ```
  - Show detailed device information:
    ```bash
    nmcli device show
    ```

### Viewing IP Routes
- **`ip route`**: Displays the routing table.
  ```bash
  ip route
  ```
  **Example Output**:
  ```
  default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 proto static metric 100
  192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.100 metric 100
  ```

### Checking Connectivity

  ```bash
  traceroute google.com
  ```
  **Example Output**:
  ```
  traceroute to google.com (142.250.190.78), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
   1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  0.234 ms  0.189 ms  0.176 ms
   ...
  ```

## Troubleshooting Ports and Services

Troubleshooting network services involves checking open ports and socket connections.

### Using `ss` for Socket Statistics
- **Show all listening TCP ports**:
  ```bash
  ss -ltn
  ```
  **Example Output**:
  ```
  Netid  State      Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address:Port   Peer Address:Port
  tcp    LISTEN     0      128     0.0.0.0:22          0.0.0.0:*
  ```

- **Show all established TCP connections**:
  ```bash
  ss -tan
  ```

- **Show sockets with process information**:
  ```bash
  ss -p
  ```

- **Show listening UDP ports**:
  ```bash
  ss -lun
  ```

**Note**: The `ss` command is part of the `iproute2` package, included by default in RHEL 8 and 9.

## Configuring Network from the Command Line

RHEL supports different configuration methods depending on the version.

### For RHEL 8
RHEL 8 uses `ifcfg` files in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`.

#### Example: Static IP Configuration
```bash
# /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
DEVICE=eth0
TYPE=Ethernet
NM_CONTROLLED=yes
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=none
IPADDR=192.168.1.100
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
DNS1=8.8.8.8
DNS2=8.8.4.4
```

**Apply Changes**:
```bash
systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### For RHEL 9
RHEL 9 uses keyfiles in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` by default [RHEL 9 Networking](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rhel-9-networking-say-goodbye-ifcfg-files-and-hello-keyfiles).

#### Example: Static IP Keyfile
```bash
# /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/static-eth0.nmconnection
[connection]
id=static-eth0
type=ethernet
interface-name=eth0
autoconnect=true

[ipv4]
method=manual
addresses1=192.168.1.100/24,192.168.1.1
dns=8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4;
```

**Apply Changes**:
```bash
nmcli connection reload
```

**Note**: Direct editing of keyfiles is possible but not recommended. Use `nmcli` for configuration to ensure consistency.

## Managing Network with `nmcli`

`nmcli` is the primary tool for managing NetworkManager in RHEL 8 and 9.

### Viewing Network Information
- **Device Status**:
  ```bash
  nmcli device status
  ```

- **List All Connections**:
  ```bash
  nmcli connection show
  ```

- **List Active Connections**:
  ```bash
  nmcli connection show --active
  ```

- **Detailed Device Information**:
  ```bash
  nmcli device show
  ```

### Adding a Network Connection
- **Static Connection**:
  ```bash
  nmcli connection add con-name static-eth0 type ethernet ifname eth0 ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.100/24 gw4 192.168.1.1 connection.autoconnect yes ipv4.method manual
  ```

- **Dynamic (DHCP) Connection**:
  ```bash
  nmcli connection add con-name dynamic-eth0 ifname eth0 autoconnect yes ipv4.method auto
  ```

### Advanced `nmcli` Examples
- **Creating a Bond Interface**:
  - Bonds combine multiple interfaces for redundancy or increased bandwidth.
  ```bash
  # Create bond connection
  nmcli con add type bond ifname bond0 con-name bond0 mode active-backup primary eth0
  # Add slave interfaces
  nmcli con add type ethernet ifname eth0 master bond0
  nmcli con add type ethernet ifname eth1 master bond0
  # Configure IP
  nmcli con mod bond0 ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.100/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1
  nmcli con up bond0
  ```

- **Configuring a VLAN**:
  - VLANs segment networks logically.
  ```bash
  # Create VLAN connection
  nmcli con add type vlan ifname vlan10 dev eth0 id 10 con-name vlan10
  # Configure IP
  nmcli con mod vlan10 ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.10.100/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.10.1
  nmcli con up vlan10
  ```

- **Static IP with Multiple DNS Servers**:
  ```bash
  nmcli con add type ethernet ifname eth0 con-name static-eth0
  nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.100/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
  nmcli con up static-eth0
  ```

### Activating/Deactivating Connections
- **Activate**:
  ```bash
  nmcli connection up static-eth0
  ```

- **Deactivate**:
  ```bash
  nmcli connection down static-eth0
  ```

### Using `nmtui`
- Launch the text-based user interface:
  ```bash
  nmtui
  ```

## Configuring Host Names and Name Resolution

### Modifying Hostnames
- **Set Persistent Hostname**:
  ```bash
  hostnamectl set-hostname server01.example.com
  ```

- **Verify Hostname**:
  ```bash
  hostnamectl status
  ```

### Configuring DNS Resolution
- **Add DNS Servers with `nmcli`**:
  ```bash
  nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
  nmcli con down static-eth0
  nmcli con up static-eth0
  ```

- **Check `/etc/resolv.conf`**:
  ```bash
  cat /etc/resolv.conf
  ```
  **Example Output**:
  ```
  nameserver 8.8.8.8
  nameserver 8.8.4.4
  ```

## Goal and Objectives

### Goal
Archive and copy files securely between Linux systems using common tools, with a focus on CentOS 9 environments.

### Objectives
1. Archive files and directories into compressed files using `tar`.
2. Extract contents from `tar` archives.
3. Transfer files securely using SSH-based tools (SCP, SFTP) and synchronize with `rsync`.
4. Download files from the web using `wget` and `cURL`.
5. Use advanced options like exclusions, incremental backups, and automation.

## Managing Compressed TAR Archives

The `tar` command is the cornerstone of archiving in Linux, used to bundle files and directories into a single file, often compressed.

### Basic `tar` Options
| **Option** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| `-c`       | Create a new archive. |
| `-x`       | Extract files from an archive. |
| `-t`       | List archive contents. |
| `-v`       | Verbose output (show processed files). |
| `-f`       | Specify the archive file name. |
| `-p`       | Preserve file permissions during extraction. |

### Examples
- **Create an Archive**:
  ```bash
  tar -cvf mysql_backup.tar /var/lib/mysql
  ```
  Archives the MySQL data directory (`/var/lib/mysql`) on `slave3` (192.168.64.133) into `mysql_backup.tar`.

- **List Archive Contents**:
  ```bash
  tar -tvf mysql_backup.tar
  ```
  Shows files, permissions, and timestamps in the archive.

- **Extract an Archive**:
  ```bash
  tar -xvf mysql_backup.tar
  ```
  Restores files to the current directory.

## Creating Compressed Archives

Compression reduces archive size, making storage and transfer more efficient. `tar` supports multiple compression algorithms.

### Compression Methods
| **Method** | **Extension** | **Speed** | **Compression Ratio** |
|------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| gzip       | `.tar.gz`     | Fast      | Moderate              |
| bzip2      | `.tar.bz2`    | Slower    | Better                |
| xz         | `.tar.xz`     | Slowest   | Best                  |

### Examples
- **gzip Compression**:
  ```bash
  tar -czf mysql_backup.tar.gz /var/lib/mysql
  ```
  Creates a gzip-compressed archive of MySQL data.

- **bzip2 Compression**:
  ```bash
  tar -cjf mysql_backup.tar.bz2 /var/lib/mysql
  ```

- **xz Compression**:
  ```bash
  tar -cJf mysql_backup.tar.xz /var/lib/mysql
  ```

## Extracting Compressed Archives

Extracting compressed archives requires specifying the correct compression method.

### Examples
- **Extract `.tar.gz`**:
  ```bash
  tar -xzf mysql_backup.tar.gz
  ```

- **Extract `.tar.bz2`**:
  ```bash
  tar -xjf mysql_backup.tar.bz2
  ```

- **Extract `.tar.xz`**:
  ```bash
  tar -xJf mysql_backup.tar.xz
  ```

### Advanced Extraction
- **Extract to Specific Directory**:
  ```bash
  tar -xzf mysql_backup.tar.gz -C /tmp/restore_mysql
  ```
  Restores files to `/tmp/restore_mysql`.

- **Preserve Permissions**:
  ```bash
  tar -xvpf mysql_backup.tar
  ```

## Compressing and Extracting Individual Files

For single files, use standalone compression tools instead of `tar`.

### Compression Examples
- **gzip**:
  ```bash
  gzip mysqld.log
  ```
  Creates `mysqld.log.gz`.

- **bzip2**:
  ```bash
  bzip2 mysqld.log
  ```

- **xz**:
  ```bash
  xz mysqld.log
  ```

### Extraction Examples
- **gunzip**:
  ```bash
  gunzip mysqld.log.gz
  ```

- **bunzip2**:
  ```bash
  bunzip2 mysqld.log.bz2
  ```

- **unxz**:
  ```bash
  unxz mysqld.log.xz
  ```

## Transferring Files Securely Using SSH

SSH-based tools like SCP and SFTP provide secure file transfers between systems.

### Using SCP
- **Local to Remote**:
  ```bash
  scp mysql_backup.tar.gz osboxes@192.168.64.131:/home/osboxes/backups/
  ```
  Transfers the MySQL backup from the local system to `slave1` (192.168.64.131).

- **Remote to Local**:
  ```bash
  scp osboxes@192.168.64.133:/var/log/mysqld.log .
  ```
  Copies the MySQL log from `slave3` to the local system.

### Using SFTP
- **Connect to Remote Host**:
  ```bash
  sftp osboxes@192.168.64.133
  ```

- **SFTP Commands**:
  - Upload:
    ```bash
    put mysql_backup.tar.gz
    ```
  - Download:
    ```bash
    get mysqld.log
    ```
  - List remote files:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
  - Change directory:
    ```bash
    cd /home/osboxes/backups
    ```

## Downloading Files with wget and cURL

`wget` and `cURL` are powerful tools for downloading files from the web, useful for fetching MySQL configurations, patches, or scripts.

### Using wget
- **Basic Download**:
  ```bash
  wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm
  ```
  Downloads the MySQL 8.0 RPM for CentOS 9 to the current directory.

- **Resume Partial Download**:
  ```bash
  wget -c https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm
  ```
  Resumes a partially downloaded file.

- **Download with Authentication**:
  ```bash
  wget --user=username --password=pass https://example.com/file.tar.gz
  ```

- **Recursive Download**:
  ```bash
  wget -r -np -l 1 https://example.com/docs/
  ```
  Downloads a directory’s contents (1 level deep, no parent directories).

### Using cURL
- **Basic Download**:
  ```bash
  curl -O https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm
  ```
  Saves the file with its original name.

- **Save to Specific File**:
  ```bash
  curl https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm -o mysql.rpm
  ```

- **Resume Download**:
  ```bash
  curl -C - -O https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el9-1.noarch.rpm
  ```

- **Download with Authentication**:
  ```bash
  curl -u username:pass https://example.com/file.tar.gz -o file.tar.gz
  ```

### wget vs cURL
| **Feature** | **wget** | **cURL** |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Recursive downloads | Yes | No |
| Resume downloads | Yes | Yes |
| Authentication | Basic | Advanced (e.g., OAuth) |
| Output control | Simple | Flexible (e.g., headers, POST) |

## Advanced Tips and Automation

### Advanced tar Examples
- **Handle Sparse Files**:
  ```bash
  tar -cvf mysql_sparse.tar --sparse /var/lib/mysql/sparse_file
  ```
  Efficiently archives sparse files (e.g., large database files with empty blocks).

- **Multi-Volume Archives**:
  ```bash
  tar -cvf mysql_backup.tar -M -L 100M /var/lib/mysql
  ```
  Splits the archive into 100MB chunks for large datasets.

- **Verify Archive Integrity**:
  ```bash
  tar -tvf mysql_backup.tar.gz > /dev/null
  ```
  Checks for errors in the archive.

### Advanced rsync Examples
- **Remote Backup**:
  ```bash
  rsync -avz /var/lib/mysql/ osboxes@192.168.64.131:/home/osboxes/mysql_backup/
  ```
  Synchronizes MySQL data to `slave1`.

- **Dry Run**:
  ```bash
  rsync -avz --dry-run /var/lib/mysql/ osboxes@192.168.64.131:/home/osboxes/mysql_backup/
  ```
  Simulates the transfer to preview changes.

- **Limit Bandwidth**:
  ```bash
  rsync -avz --bwlimit=1000 /var/lib/mysql/ osboxes@192.168.64.131:/home/osboxes/mysql_backup/
  ```
  Caps transfer speed at 1MB/s.

### Automation with Shell Scripts
- **Backup and Transfer Script**:
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  TIMESTAMP=$(date +%F)
  tar -czf /tmp/mysql_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz /var/lib/mysql
  scp /tmp/mysql_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz osboxes@192.168.64.131:/home/osboxes/backups/
  rm /tmp/mysql_backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz
  ```
  Save as `backup_mysql.sh`, make executable (`chmod +x backup_mysql.sh`), and run daily via cron:
  ```bash
  crontab -e
  0 2 * * * /home/mahdy/backup_mysql.sh
  ```

### Automation with Ansible
To automate archiving and transferring MySQL backups in your Ansible setup:
```yaml
---
- name: Backup and transfer MySQL data
  hosts: db
  tasks:
    - name: Create compressed archive of MySQL data
      archive:
        path: /var/lib/mysql
        dest: /tmp/mysql_backup_{{ ansible_date_time.iso8601_basic_short }}.tar.gz
        format: gz
    - name: Transfer backup to slave1
      command: scp /tmp/mysql_backup_{{ ansible_date_time.iso8601_basic_short }}.tar.gz osboxes@192.168.64.131:/home/osboxes/backups/
    - name: Clean up local backup
      file:
        path: /tmp/mysql_backup_{{ ansible_date_time.iso8601_basic_short }}.tar.gz
        state: absent
```
Save as `backup_mysql.yml` and run:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml backup_mysql.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

# Installing and Updating Software Packages in RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)


### **Goal**  
This guide explains how to download, install, update, and manage software packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) using both RPM and YUM. It covers the structure of RPM packages, common commands for package management, how to work with YUM repositories, and provides practical examples and advanced tips.

---

## 1. Understanding RPM Software Packages

RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) is the low-level tool used for managing software on RHEL and other RPM-based Linux distributions. Each RPM package follows a naming convention that provides key details:

```
name-version-release-architecture.rpm
```

- **Name:** The package’s name (e.g., `nginx`, `vim`).
- **Version:** The upstream version of the software (e.g., `1.20.1`).
- **Release:** The package’s revision or build number (e.g., `1.el9`).
- **Architecture:** The target hardware architecture (e.g., `x86_64` or `noarch` for architecture-independent packages).

**Example:**  
For the file `nginx-1.20.1-1.el9.x86_64.rpm`:

- **Version:** `1.20.1`
- **Release:** `1.el9`
- **Architecture:** `x86_64`

---

## 2. Key RPM Commands

RPM provides various commands for querying, installing, upgrading, and removing packages.

### **Querying Packages**

- **List all installed packages:**
  ```bash
  rpm -qa
  ```
  *This command lists every package installed on the system, useful for auditing software.*

- **Query a specific package:**
  ```bash
  rpm -q vim-enhanced
  ```
  *Returns version and release details for the package `vim-enhanced`.*

- **Find which package owns a specific file:**
  ```bash
  rpm -qf /usr/bin/htpasswd
  ```
  *Helps determine which package provides a particular file.*

- **Get detailed package information:**
  ```bash
  rpm -qi httpd
  ```
  *Displays comprehensive information (description, install date, vendor, etc.) for the Apache HTTP Server package.*

- **List files installed by a package:**
  ```bash
  rpm -ql python3
  ```
  *Shows all files that were installed as part of the `python3` package.*

- **View package installation/removal scripts:**
  ```bash
  rpm -q --scripts package-name
  ```
  *Reveals any pre- or post-installation scripts included in the package.*

### **Installing, Upgrading, and Removing Packages**

- **Install an RPM package:**
  ```bash
  rpm -ivh package.rpm
  ```
  *Options:*
  - `-i`: Install
  - `-v`: Verbose output
  - `-h`: Display progress with hash marks

  ```
  *Installs the NGINX web server package.*

- **Upgrade an existing package:**
  ```bash
  rpm -Uvh package.rpm
  ```
  *Example:*
  ```bash
  rpm -Uvh nginx-1.20.1-2.el9.x86_64.rpm
  ```
  *Upgrades NGINX to a newer release while preserving system stability.*

- **Remove a package:**
  ```bash
  rpm -ev package-name
  ```
  *Example:*
  ```bash
  rpm -ev nginx
  ```
  *Uninstalls the NGINX package from your system.*

## 3. Managing Packages with YUM

YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) is a higher-level package management tool that works on top of RPM. It simplifies package installations by automatically resolving dependencies and managing repositories.

### **Common YUM Commands**

- **List installed and available packages:**
  ```bash
  yum list
  ```
  *Lists every package available in the enabled repositories, as well as those already installed.*

- **Search for a package:**
  ```bash
  yum search httpd
  ```
  *Searches for packages related to `httpd` (the Apache HTTP Server).*

- **Install a package from a repository:**
  ```bash
  yum install httpd
  ```
  *Installs the Apache HTTP Server package and automatically pulls in all required dependencies.*

- **Update a specific package:**
  ```bash
  yum update httpd
  ```
  *Updates the Apache package to the latest version available in the repository.*

- **Update all packages:**
  ```bash
  yum update
  ```
  *Ensures that every installed package on the system is updated.*

- **Remove a package:**
  ```bash
  yum remove httpd
  ```
  *Uninstalls Apache and cleans up dependencies that are no longer needed.*

- **View YUM transaction history:**
  ```bash
  yum history
  ```
  *Displays a log of past package transactions (installations, updates, removals) for tracking changes.*

- **Clean YUM cache:**
  ```bash
  yum clean all
  ```
  *Clears cached metadata and package data, which is useful for troubleshooting or freeing disk space.*

## 4. Creating and Managing Local Yum Repositories

Local Yum repositories are useful in isolated environments or when you want to control which packages are available to your systems.

### **Steps to Create a Local Repository**

1. **Mount the ISO or local directory containing RPMs:**
   ```bash
   mount -o loop /dev/sr0 /mnt
   ```
   *Example:* Mounts an ISO image from a DVD drive to `/mnt`.*

2. **Create repository configuration files in `/etc/yum.repos.d/`:**

   - **AppStream Repository:**
     ```ini
     [Local_AppStream]
     name=RHEL9 Local AppStream Repository
     baseurl=file:///mnt/AppStream
     enabled=1
     gpgcheck=0
     ```

   - **BaseOS Repository:**
     ```ini
     [Local_BaseOS]
     name=RHEL9 Local BaseOS Repository
     baseurl=file:///mnt/BaseOS
     enabled=1
     gpgcheck=0
     ```

3. **Verify the repository is enabled:**
   ```bash
   yum repolist
   ```
   *This command shows all active repositories, confirming your local repository appears in the list.*

4. **Disable subscription warnings (if needed):**  
   Edit `/etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf` and change:
   ```ini
   enabled=0
   ```
   *This prevents subscription manager warnings during package installations.*

---

## 5. Application Streams in RHEL 9

In RHEL 9, the software is divided into two main repositories:
- **BaseOS:** Contains the core operating system components.
- **AppStream:** Contains additional applications, middleware, and runtime libraries.

Using these separate repositories helps to isolate critical OS components from user applications, making updates and maintenance easier and more secure.

---

## 6. Advanced Tips and Examples

### **Example 1: Installing a Local RPM with Dependency Resolution**

When installing a local RPM file that might have dependencies not already on the system, use:
```bash
yum localinstall /path/to/package.rpm
```
*YUM will automatically search for and install any missing dependencies from your repositories.*

### **Example 2: Rolling Back an Update Using Yum History**

If an update causes issues, you can roll back a transaction:
1. **List transaction history:**
   ```bash
   yum history
   ```
2. **Undo a specific transaction:**
   ```bash
   yum history undo <transaction-id>
   ```
*This feature helps to revert to a previous state if an update destabilizes your system.*

### **Example 3: Automating System Updates with Cron**

Automate updates by scheduling a cron job:
1. **Edit the crontab:**
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
2. **Add a daily update at 2 AM:**
   ```cron
   0 2 * * * /usr/bin/yum update -y
   ```
*This ensures your system remains up to date with minimal manual intervention.*

# **Accessing Linux File Systems**

### **Goal**
- Access, inspect, and use existing file systems on storage attached to a Linux server.

### **Objectives**
- List the block devices and file systems.
- Mount and unmount file systems and partitions in Linux.
- Search for files on mounted file systems using the `find` and `locate` commands.

---

## **File system and mount points**

- To make the contents of a file system available in the file-system hierarchy, it must be mounted on an empty directory.
- This directory is called a **mount point**. Once mounted, if you use the `ls` command to list that directory, you will see the contents of the mounted file system, and you can access and use those files normally.
- Many file systems are automatically mounted as part of the boot process.

---

## **Examining file systems**

- To get an overview of local and remote file system devices and the amount of free space available, run the `df` command.
  
  ```bash
  df       # report file system disk space usage
  df -h    # print sizes in human-readable format (powers of 1024)
  ```

- **`du`**: Shows the size of all files in the current directory tree recursively.

  ```bash
  du -h    # human-readable format
  ```

---

## **Identifying the block device**

- Use the `lsblk` command to list the details of a specified block device or all available devices.

  ```bash
  lsblk -fp   # lists file system type and provides more details
  ```

---

## **Mounting and unmounting file systems**

- There are two common ways to specify the file system on a disk partition for the `mount` command:
  1. With the name of the device file in `/dev` containing the file system.
  2. With the UUID written to the file system, a universally-unique identifier (UUID).

### **Examples**:

- **Mounting using the name of the device:**

  ```bash
  mount <blockname> <dirname>
  mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/data   # mounts /dev/vdb1 on /mnt/data
  mount /dev/nvme0n1p6 /data  # mounts /dev/nvme0n1p6 on /data
  ```

- **Mounting using UUID**:

  To get the UUID:

  ```bash
  lsblk -fd     # or blkid
  ```

  Then mount it using:

  ```bash
  mount UUID="<UUID>" <dirname>
  ```

- **Unmounting** a file system:

  ```bash
  umount <dirname>
  umount /data   # unmounts /data
  ```

- **Finding processes accessing a particular directory**:

  ```bash
  lsof /data    # shows processes using /data
  ```

- **`blkid`**: Prints block device attributes, such as UUIDs.


# **Searching for files on mounted file systems**

### **Locating files on the system**

A system administrator needs tools to search for files matching certain criteria on the file system. This section discusses two commands that can search for files in the file-system hierarchy:

1. **`locate`**: Searches a pre-generated index for file names or file paths and returns results instantly. It is fast because it looks up this information from the `mlocate` database.

   - However, this database is not updated in real time, so it must be frequently updated for results to be accurate.
   - The `locate` database is automatically updated every day, but the root user can manually update it by issuing the `updatedb` command.

#### **Examples**:

- **Locate** a file by name or path:

  ```bash
  locate file1          # searches for file1
  locate -i file1       # case-insensitive search
  locate -n 5 file1     # limit results to 5 entries
  ```

### **Searching for files in real time**

2. **`find`**: Performs a real-time search in the file-system hierarchy. It is slower than `locate` but more accurate. It can search for files based on various criteria, such as name, permissions, type, size, or modification time.

   - The `find` command searches files based on the account that executed the search. The user must have **read** and **execute** permissions on a directory to examine its contents.

#### **Examples**:

- **Search by name**:

  ```bash
  find <location> -name <filename>
  find / -name sshd_config            # searches for files named sshd_config starting from the / directory
  find / -name '*.txt'                # searches for all .txt files
  ```

- **Case-insensitive search by name**:

  ```bash
  find / -iname '*messages*'   # searches for files containing 'messages' in their names
  ```

- **Search by file owner**:

  ```bash
  find -user <username>
  find -user mohamed           # searches for files owned by mohamed
  ```

- **Search by group owner**:

  ```bash
  find -group <groupname>
  find -group mohamed          # searches for files owned by group mohamed
  ```

- **Search by user ID (UID)**:

  ```bash
  find -uid <uid>
  find -uid 1000               # searches for files owned by user with UID 1000
  ```

- **Search by file ownership and group**:

  ```bash
  find / -user root -group mail  # files owned by root and affiliated with group mail
  ```

---

## **Searching files based on permissions**

- The **`-perm`** option is used to search for files with a specific set of permissions, described as octal values (e.g., 764).

#### **Examples**:

- **Search for files with permissions 764**:

  ```bash
  find /home -perm 764
  ```

- **Search for files with at least specified permissions**:

  ```bash
  find /home -perm -324
  ```

---

## **Searching files based on size**

- Use the `-size` option with the `find` command, followed by a numerical value and the unit.
  
  **Units**:  
  - `k`: kilobyte  
  - `M`: megabyte  
  - `G`: gigabyte  

#### **Examples**:

- **Search for files of exactly 10 MB**:

  ```bash
  find / -size 10M
  ```

- **Search for files larger than 10 GB**:

  ```bash
  find / -size +10G
  ```

- **Search for files smaller than 10 KB**:

  ```bash
  find / -size -10k
  ```

- **Preallocate space for a file (1 GB)**:

  ```bash
  fallocate -l 1G file1
  ```

---

## **Searching files based on modification time**

- The **`-mmin`** option, followed by time in minutes, searches for files whose content was changed a certain number of minutes ago.  
  **Use `+`** for more than a certain time, and **`-`** for less than.

#### **Examples**:

- **Search for files modified exactly 120 minutes ago**:

  ```bash
  find / -mmin 120
  ```

- **Search for files modified more than 200 minutes ago**:

  ```bash
  find / -mmin +200
  ```

---

## **Searching files based on type**

- The **`-type`** option limits the search to a specific file type.  
  **Types**:  
  - `f`: regular file  
  - `d`: directory  
  - `l`: symbolic link  
  - `b`: block device

#### **Examples**:

- **Search for all directories in `/etc`**:

  ```bash
  find /etc -type d
  ```

- **Search for all symbolic links**:

  ```bash
  find / -type l
  ```

- **List all block devices in `/dev`**:

  ```bash
  find /dev -type b
  ```

---

## **Summary**
- **Block devices** represent storage devices in Linux.
- **The `df` command** reports disk usage and available space.
- **The `mount` command** attaches a file system, while `umount` detaches it.
- **The `find` command** performs real-time searches in local file systems based on various criteria like name, permissions, ownership, size, and modification time.

# Understanding DNS (Domain Name System)

## What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to resolve human-readable domain names (e.g., `www.example.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., `192.0.2.1`). This system enables users to access websites and other online resources without needing to remember numeric IP addresses.

### Key Concepts in DNS:
1. **Domain Name**:
   - A domain name is a human-readable address like `www.google.com`.
   - It is broken into hierarchical parts: `subdomain.domain.tld` (e.g., `www.example.com`).

2. **DNS Server**:
   - A DNS server is a system that holds records for domain-to-IP mappings and resolves queries.
   - Common types of DNS servers:
     - **Recursive Resolver**: Receives queries from clients and resolves them by querying other DNS servers if necessary.
     - **Authoritative Server**: Contains the original source of the domain information (zone files).

3. **DNS Record Types**:
   - **A Record**: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
   - **AAAA Record**: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
   - **CNAME**: Alias of one domain to another.
   - **MX Record**: Mail exchange record, used for email routing.
   - **TXT Record**: Miscellaneous text information.

4. **DNS Hierarchy**:
   - **Root Servers**: The top level of the DNS hierarchy.
   - **TLD Servers**: Handle Top-Level Domains like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`.
   - **Authoritative Servers**: Store specific domain records.

5. **DNS Query Types**:
   - **Recursive Query**: The resolver queries multiple DNS servers to find the answer.
   - **Iterative Query**: The resolver provides the client with a referral to another DNS server if it doesn't know the answer.

---

## How DNS Works:
1. A user enters `www.example.com` in a web browser.
2. The request goes to a DNS resolver (ISP or system-configured).
3. The resolver queries the root DNS server to find the TLD server for `.com`.
4. The resolver queries the `.com` TLD server to find the authoritative server for `example.com`.
5. The authoritative server responds with the IP address for `www.example.com`.
6. The user’s device uses the IP address to connect to the desired web server.

---

## Practical Application: Configuring DNS Resolution Order on Linux

On Linux, the **resolution order** determines whether the system checks the `hosts` file or DNS first when resolving names. You can configure this using the `nsswitch.conf` file.

### Steps:

1. **Check the Current Resolution Order**:
   Open the file `/etc/nsswitch.conf` to see the current order:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
   ```
   Look for a line like this:
   ```plaintext
   hosts: files dns
   ```
   By default, the system checks the local `hosts` file first, then DNS.

2. **Change the Resolution Order**:
   Edit the `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nsswitch.conf
   ```
   Modify the `hosts` line to:
   ```plaintext
   hosts: dns files
   ```
   This makes the system check DNS first before falling back to the local `hosts` file.

3. **Understand `/etc/resolv.conf`**:
   The `/etc/resolv.conf` file contains the DNS server configuration used by the system. To specify or check the DNS servers:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
   Example content:
   ```plaintext
   nameserver 8.8.8.8
   nameserver 8.8.4.4
   ```
   - Each `nameserver` entry specifies the IP address of a DNS server.
   - You can edit this file to add or modify DNS servers:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
     ```
     Add DNS server entries as needed.

4. **Understand `/etc/hosts`**:
   The `/etc/hosts` file is a local database for mapping hostnames to IP addresses. It is used before DNS queries (depending on the resolution order in `nsswitch.conf`).
   ```bash
   cat /etc/hosts
   ```
   Example content:
   ```plaintext
   127.0.0.1   localhost
   192.168.1.10   example.local
   ```
   - Add entries to manually resolve hostnames to specific IPs.
   - Edit the file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/hosts
     ```

5. **Verify Changes**:
   Save the file and test the resolution order by running:
   ```bash
   getent hosts example.com
   ```
   This command will resolve the domain using the configured order.

6. **Flush Cache (if necessary)**:
   If using a caching service like `systemd-resolved`, restart the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
   ```

### Testing DNS:
You can use tools like `nslookup` or `dig` to test DNS resolution:

- **Using `nslookup`**:
  ```bash
  nslookup www.google.com
  ```
  This will query the DNS server for `www.google.com`.

- **Using `dig`**:
  ```bash
  dig www.google.com
  ```
  This provides detailed information about the DNS query and response.

# Expanding the Root Partition `</dev/nvm....>`

To expand the root partition and take advantage of the extra unused space, follow these steps:
---

## 0. Identify Your Disk

Before proceeding, confirm the disk name by listing all block devices:
```bash
lsblk
```
Review the output to identify your primary disk (e.g., `/dev/nvme0n1`). This ensures you’re working on the correct disk.

---

## 1. Verify Disk Layout

First, confirm that the unallocated space is **after** the root partition:

```bash
sudo parted /dev/nvme0n1 unit GB print
```

Ensure that the free space appears **after** `nvme0n1p2` [[1]][[9]].

---

## 2. Expand the Partition

Use `growpart` to extend partition 2 (`nvme0n1p2`) to fill the disk:

```bash
sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 2
```

This command adjusts the partition table to include all available space [[1]][[8]].

---

## 3. Resize the Filesystem

Resize the filesystem (e.g., `ext4`) to utilize the new partition size:

```bash
sudo resize2fs /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

If you're unsure of the filesystem type, check it with:

```bash
file -s /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

This step ensures the filesystem is expanded to match the partition's new size [[9]].

---

## 4. Verify the Change

Check the updated disk usage:

```bash
df -h
```

The root partition (`/`) should now display around 60GB total, with approximately 40GB free [[1]][[9]].

---

## Troubleshooting

- **If ****************`growpart`**************** fails:**\
  Try rebooting and retrying the command. Alternatively, use `parted` in a live environment:
  ```bash
  sudo parted /dev/nvme0n1
  (parted) resizepart 2 100%
  ```
- **For Btrfs/ZFS Filesystems:**\
  Instead of `resize2fs`, use:
  ```bash
  sudo btrfs filesystem resize max /
  ```
  or for ZFS:
  ```bash
  sudo zfs set volsize=... <pool>/<dataset>
  ```
  [[9]].

---

## Why This Works

- **`growpart`** dynamically resizes the partition without needing to unmount it [[1]].
- **`resize2fs`** expands the filesystem to fully utilize the new partition size [[9]].
