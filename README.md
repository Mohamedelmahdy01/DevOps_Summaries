## üñ•Ô∏è System Administration I & II Topics

### **System Administration I**
   - **Overview**: Basic system administration tasks, focusing on fundamental concepts of managing Linux/Unix-based systems.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - User and group management.
     - File permissions and access control.
     - Basic networking and firewall configuration.
     - Package management and software installation.
     - System monitoring and logging.

### **System Administration II**
   - **Overview**: Advanced system administration tasks, building on System Administration I to cover more complex operations.
   - **Key Topics**:
     - Managing services and daemons.
     - Advanced networking (DNS, DHCP, VPN, etc.).
     - Performance tuning and resource management.
     - Backup strategies and disaster recovery.
     - Automation with shell scripting and tools like Ansible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps Tools Covered
